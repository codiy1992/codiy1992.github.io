&lt;h2 id="概述">概述&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>基于家庭网络使用工控机、NAS 自建各种服务/系统. 如 ESXi, PVE, ROS, OpenWrt, bitwarden, minio, jackett,
qBittorrent 等.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>基础设施:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>宽带与光猫&lt;/li>
&lt;li>工控机(IPC, 软路由)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>虚拟机系统(ESXi, PVE)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>路由器系统(RouterOS, OpenWrt)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NAS设备&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>相关网络基础知识&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>路由&lt;/li>
&lt;li>网关&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ARP协议&lt;/li>
&lt;li>交换机&lt;/li>
&lt;li>网桥&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DNS, DHCP, NAT&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="宽带与光猫">宽带与光猫&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>光猫由路由模式设置为桥接模式(自己设置不了就打给客服)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>拨号发现为局域网IP, 打给客服要求分配公网IP(一般不需要理由，要的话就说家里装监控需要公网IP)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>拨号账号账号密码, 光猫管理员账号密码&lt;/li>
&lt;li>宽带是否支持多拨(多次拨号，可获得多个公网IP)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>家庭宽带拨号获得的公网IP, 运营商一般默认屏蔽了&lt;strong>80&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>443&lt;/strong>端口&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="esxi-pve">ESXi, PVE&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>官网镜像下载, ventoy 制作启动U盘&lt;/li>
&lt;li>开机进 BIOS 选择引导方式优先级&lt;/li>
&lt;li>进入 ESXi 安装界面, 快速按 Shift + o, 输入命令 限制缓存用的磁盘大小&lt;/li>
&lt;li>安装完后, 管理网口选到 eht0, 然后设置IP地址&lt;/li>
&lt;li>用网线将 eth0 与电脑连接。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>电脑上设置IPV4属性，使得可以桥接到 ESXi.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>电脑上浏览器输入 ESXi 管理地址，进行虚拟机管理.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="1-基本思想">1 基本思想&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>冒泡排序算法是重复地走访要排序的数列，一次比较相邻的两个元素，如果他们的顺序与排序要求相反，就将它们互换，直到没有再需要交换的数字，则说明排序完成。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-算法过程">2 算法过程&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>1、比较相邻的两个元素，如果前面的数大于后面的数，就将两个数进行交换；&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2、从开始第一对到结尾的最后一对，对每一对相邻元素作第1）操作。这步做完后，最大的数就会沉到数组的最后。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3、然后再从头开始，重复第 1 和第 2 操作，直到倒数第二位时结束。&lt;/p>

最好的情况：待排序记录按关键字从小到大排列（正序），需要比较n-1次，时间复杂度为O(n);
最坏的情况：待排序记录按关键字从大到小排列（逆序），需要比较n-1+n-2+…+1=n(n-1)/2，交换次数和比较次数等值，时间复杂度依然为O(n²)。
2、空间复杂度：O(1)，是稳定排序&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. 使用内置的 CA 颁发自签证书&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>可能需要根据提示输入主机密码来将根证书安装到本机的信任库中&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. 直接指定证书位置&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>tls {$SSL_CERT_PATH} {$SSL_KEY_PATH}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. 使用 letsencrypt 或 zerossl 来获得公共认可的 TLS 证书并自动续期&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>免费版本的 letsencrypt, zerossl 证书有效期仅有 90 天, caddy 会在到期之前自动的更新证书. 根据 &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555">ACME 协议&lt;/a>
有以下三种常见方式来验证域名&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>HTTP-01&lt;/li>
&lt;li>TLS-ALPN-01&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DNS-01&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>详细说明见 &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/">Challenge Types&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>值得注意的是 ACME 协议和 letsencrypt, zerossl 只使用标准的 http, https, dns 端口(即 80, 443, 53) 来验证&lt;br>
域名. 对于家庭网络公有IP的 &lt;code>80, 443&lt;/code> 端口可能被运营商默认屏蔽, 因此无法在家庭网络中正常的使用 &lt;code>http-01&lt;/code> 和 &lt;code>tls-alpn-01&lt;/code> 方式验证域名&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>对于 &lt;code>DNS-01&lt;/code> Chanllege, Caddy 提供了一系列的模块来支持 DNS 验证, 比如 &lt;code>route53&lt;/code>, &lt;code>alidns&lt;/code>, &lt;code>cloudflare&lt;/code> 等,

&lt;p>插入排序算法是每一步将一个待排序的数据插入到前面已经排好序的有序序列中，直到所有元素插入完毕为止。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-算法过程">2 算法过程&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>1、将第一个元素看做一个有序序列，把第二个元素到最后一个元素当成是未排序序列；&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2、从头到尾依次扫描未排序序列，将扫描到的每个元素插入有序序列的适当位置（如果待插入的元素与有序序列中的某个元素相等，则将待插入元素插入到相等元素的后面，这样的插入方式，排序是稳定的）。&lt;/p>

最好的情况：待排序记录按关键字从小到大排列（正序），需要比较n-1次，不需要交换元素，时间复杂度为O(n);
最坏的情况：待排序记录按关键字从大到小排列（逆序），时间复杂度为O(n²)。
2、空间复杂度：O(1)，是稳定排序。&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 03-选择排序</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2020/04/03-%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E6%8E%92%E5%BA%8F/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 22:40:14 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2020/04/03-%E9%80%89%E6%8B%A9%E6%8E%92%E5%BA%8F/</guid><description>

&lt;p>选择排序算法是从前往后遍历元素，每次假定当前元素为最小元素，再次遍历剩余元素，找到找到真正最小的元素，交换位置，直到元素有序。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>1、将第一个元素当成最小元素，跟它后面的元素逐个比较，暂存最小元素的下标，第一趟结束后，将第一个数，与暂存的那个最小数进行交换，第一个数就是最小数
2、下标移到第二位，第二个数跟后面的所有数相比，一趟下来，确定第二小数
3、重复以上步骤，直到有序&lt;/p>

&lt;p>通过一趟排序将待排记录分隔成独立的两部分，其中一部分记录的关键字均比另一部分的关键字小，则可分别对这两部分记录继续进行排序，以达到整个序列有序。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-算法过程">2 算法过程&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>1、从数列中挑出一个元素，称为 “基准”（pivot）；
2、将待排序元素进行分区，比基准值小的元素放在基准值前面，比基准值大的元素放在基准值后面。分区结束后，该基准值就处于数组的中间位置；这个称为分区（partition）操作；
3、递归地（recursive）对左右两个分区重复以上步骤直到所有元素都是有序的。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>归并排序算法是将两个（或两个以上）有序表合并成一个新的有序表，即把待排序序列分为若干个子序列，使每个子序列有序，再将已有序的子序列合并，得到完全有序的序列。该算法是采用分治法（Divide and Conquer）的一个非常典型的应用。&lt;/p>

2、“合并”——将划分后的序列段两两合并后排序。&lt;/p>

2、空间复杂度：O(n)
算法处理过程中，需要一个大小为 n 的临时存储空间保存合并序列，所以空间复杂度为O(n)。
3、稳定性：稳定
在归并排序中，相等的元素的顺序不会改变，所以它是稳定排序。&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 06-堆排序</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2020/04/06-%E5%A0%86%E6%8E%92%E5%BA%8F/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 22:23:21 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2020/04/06-%E5%A0%86%E6%8E%92%E5%BA%8F/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="0-堆的定义">0 堆的定义&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>堆通常是一个可以被看做一棵树的数组对象，其任一非叶节点满足以下性质：
1、堆中某个节点的值总是不大于或不小于其父节点的值：
　　每个节点的值都大于或等于其左右子节点的值，称为大顶堆。即：arr[i] &amp;gt;= arr[2i+1] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; arr[i] &amp;gt;= arr[2i+2]。
　　或：
　　每个节点的值都小于或等于其左右子节点的值，称为小顶堆。即：arr[i] &amp;lt;= arr[2i+1] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; arr[i] &amp;lt;= arr[2i+2]。
2、堆总是一棵完全二叉树。
&lt;code>注：上述公式，根节点从0开始。如果根节点从1开始，则左右子节点分别是2i和2i+1。&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-基本思想">1 基本思想&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>以大顶堆为例，将待排序的序列构造成一个大顶堆，此时，整个序列的最大值就是堆顶的根节点。将它移走（也就是将其与堆数组的末尾元素交换，此时末尾元素就是最大值），然后将剩余的n-1个序列重新构造成一个堆，这样就会得到n个元素中的次小的值。如此反复执行，便能得到一个有序序列了。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-算法过程">2 算法过程&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>1、将无需序列构建成一个堆，根据升序降序需求选择大顶堆或小顶堆;
2、将堆顶元素与末尾元素交换，将最大元素&amp;quot;沉&amp;quot;到数组末端;
3、重新调整结构，使其满足堆定义，然后继续交换堆顶元素与当前末尾元素，反复执行调整+交换步骤，直到整个序列有序。&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Bats have a problem: how to find their way around in the dark. They hunt at night, and cannot use light to help them find prey and avoid obstacles. You might say that this is a problem of their own making, one that they could avoid simply by changing their habits and hunting by day. But the daytime economy is already heavily exploited by other creatures such as birds. Given that there is a living to be made at night, and given that alternative daytime trades are thoroughly occupied, natural selection has favoured bats that make a go of the night-hunting trade. It is probable that the nocturnal trades go way back in the ancestry of all mammals. In the time when the dinosaurs dominated the daytime economy, our mammalian ancestors probably only managed to survive at all because they found ways of scraping a living at night. Only after the mysterious mass extinction of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago were our ancestors able to emerge into the daylight in any substantial numbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Bats have an engineering problem: how to find their way and find their prey in the absence of light. Bats are not the only creatures to face this difficulty today. Obviously the night-flying insects that they prey on must find their way about somehow. Deep-sea fish and whales have little or no light by day or by night. Fish and dolphins that live in extremely muddy water cannot see because, although there is light, it is obstructed and scattered by the dirt in the water. Plenty of other modern animals make their living in conditions where seeing is difficult or impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Given the questions of how to manoeuvre in the dark, what solutions might an engineer consider? The first one that might occur to him is to manufacture light, to use a lantern or a searchlight. Fireflies and some fish (usually with the help of bacteria) have the power to manufacture their own light, but the process seems to consume a large amount of energy. Fireflies use their light for attracting mates. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a prohibitive amount of energy: a male&amp;rsquo;s tiny pinprick of light can be seen by a female from some distance on a dark night, since her eyes are exposed directly to the light source itself. However, using light to find one&amp;rsquo;s own way around requires vastly more energy, since the eyes have to detect the tiny fraction of the light that bounces off each part of the scene. The light source must therefore be immensely brighter if it is to be used as a headlight to illuminate the path, than if it is to be used as a signal to others. In any event, whether or not the reason is the energy expense, it seems to be the case that, with the possible exception of some weird deep-sea fish, no animal apart from man uses manufactured light to find its way about.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What else might the engineer think of? Well, blind humans sometimes seem to have an uncanny sense of obstacles in their path. It has been given the name &amp;lsquo;facial vision&amp;rsquo;, because blind people have reported that it feels a bit like the sense of touch, on the face. One report tells of a totally blind boy who could ride his tricycle at good speed round the block near his home, using facial vision. Experiments showed that, in fact, facial vision is nothing to do with touch or the front of the face, although the sensation may be referred to the front of the face, like the referred pain in a phantom limb. The sensation of facial vision, it turns out, really goes in through the ears. Blind people, without even being aware of the fact, are actually using echoes of their own footsteps and of other sounds, to sense the presence of obstacles. Before this was discovered, engineers had already built instruments to exploit the principle, for example to measure the depth of the sea under a ship. After this technique had been invented, it was only a matter of time before weapons designers adapted it for the detection of submarines. Both sides in the Second world war relied heavily on these devices, under such codenames as Asdic (British) and Sonar (American), as well as Radar (American) or RDF (British), which uses radio echoes rather than sound echoes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Sonar and Radar pioneers didn&amp;rsquo;t know it then, but all the world now knows that bats, or rather natural selection working on bats, had perfected the system tens of millions of years earlier, and their &amp;lsquo;radar&amp;rsquo; achieves feats of detection and navigation that would strike an engineer dumb with admiration. It is technically incorrect to talk about bat &amp;lsquo;radar&amp;rsquo;, since they do not use radio waves. It is sonar. But the underlying mathematical theories of radar and sonar are very similar, and much of our scientific understanding of the details of what bats are doing has come from applying radar theory to them. The American zoologist Donald Griffin, who was largely responsible for the discovery of sonar in bats, coined the term &amp;rsquo;echolocation&amp;rsquo; to cover both sonar and radar, whether used by animals or by human instruments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R7.1.2 MAKING EVERY DROP COUNT</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r7.1.2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Aug 2022 10:09:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r7.1.2/</guid><description>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The history of human civilisation is entwined with the history of the ways we have learned to manipulate water resources. As towns gradually expanded, water was brought from increasingly remote sources, leading to sophisticated engineering efforts such as dams and aqueducts. At the height of the Roman Empire, nine major systems, with an innovative layout of pipes and well-built sewers, supplied the occupants of Rome with as much water per person as is provided in many parts of the industrial world today.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>During the industrial revolution and population explosion of the 19th and 20th centuries, the demand for water rose dramatically. Unprecedented construction of tens of thousands of monumental engineering projects designed to control floods, protect clean water supplies, and provide water for irrigation and hydropower brought great benefits to hundreds of millions of people. Food production has kept pace with soaring populations mainly because of the expansion of artificial irrigation systems that make possible the growth of 40 % of the world&amp;rsquo;s food. Nearly one fifth of all the electricity generated worldwide is produced by turbines spun by the power of falling water.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Yet there is a dark side to this picture: despite our progress, half of the world&amp;rsquo;s population still suffers, with water services inferior to those available to the ancient Greeks and Romans. As the United Nations report on access to water reiterated in November 2001, more than one billion people lack access to clean drinking water; some two and a half billion do not have adequate sanitation services. Preventable water-related diseases kill an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 children every day, and the latest evidence suggests that we are falling behind in efforts to solve these problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The consequences of our water policies extend beyond jeopardising human health. Tens of millions of people have been forced to move from their homes - often with little warning or compensation - to make way for the reservoirs behind dams. More than 20 % of all freshwater fish species are now threatened or endangered because dams and water withdrawals have destroyed the free-flowing river ecosystems where they thrive. Certain irrigation practices degrade soil quality and reduce agricultural productivity. Groundwater aquifers* are being pumped down faster than they are naturally replenished in parts of India, China, the USA and elsewhere. And disputes over shared water resources have led to violence and continue to raise local, national and even international tensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>*underground stores of water&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At the outset of the new millennium, however, the way resource planners think about water is beginning to change. The focus is slowly shifting back to the provision of basic human and environmental needs as top priority - ensuring &amp;lsquo;some for all,&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;lsquo;more for some&amp;rsquo;. Some water experts are now demanding that existing infrastructure be used in smarter ways rather than building new facilities, which is increasingly considered the option of last, not first, resort. This shift in philosophy has not been universally accepted, and it comes with strong opposition from some established water organisations. Nevertheless, it may be the only way to address successfully the pressing problems of providing everyone with clean water to drink, adequate water to grow food and a life free from preventable water-related illness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Fortunately - and unexpectedly - the demand for water is not rising as rapidly as some predicted. As a result, the pressure to build new water infrastructures has diminished over the past two decades. Although population, industrial output and economic productivity have continued to soar in developed nations, the rate at which people withdraw water from aquifers, rivers and lakes has slowed. And in a few parts of the world, demand has actually fallen.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="g">G&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What explains this remarkable turn of events? Two factors: people have figured out how to use water more efficiently, and communities are rethinking their priorities for water use. Throughout the first three-quarters of the 20th century, the quantity of freshwater consumed per person doubled on average; in the USA, water withdrawals increased tenfold while the population quadrupled. But since 1980, the amount of water consumed per person has actually decreased, thanks to a range of new technologies that help to conserve water in homes and industry. In 1965, for instance, Japan used approximately 13 million gallons* of water to produce $1 million of commercial output; by 1989 this had dropped to 3.5 million gallons (even accounting for inflation) - almost a quadrupling of water productivity. In the USA, water withdrawals have fallen by more than 20 % from their peak in 1980.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="h">H&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>On the other hand, dams, aqueducts and other kinds of infrastructure will still have to be built, particularly in developing countries where basic human needs have not been met. But such projects must be built to higher specifications and with more accountability to local people and their environment than in the past. And even in regions where new projects seem warranted, we must find ways to meet demands with fewer resources, respecting ecological criteria and to a smaller budget.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Educating Psyche by Bernie Neville is a book which looks at radical new approaches to learning, describing the effects of emotion, imagination and the unconscious on learning. One theory discussed in the book is that proposed by George Lozanov, which focuses on the power of suggestion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lozanov&amp;rsquo;s instructional technique is based on the evidence that the connections made in the brain through unconscious processing (which he calls non-specific mental reactivity) are more durable than those made through conscious processing. Besides the laboratory evidence for this, we know from our experience that we often remember what we have perceived peripherally, long after we have forgotten what we set out to learn. If we think of a book we studied months or years ago, we will find it easier to recall peripheral details - the colour, the binding, the typeface, the table at the library where we sat while studying it - than the content on which we were concentrating. If we think of a lecture we listened to with great concentration, we will recall the lecturer&amp;rsquo;s appearance and mannerisms, our place in the auditorium, the failure of the air-conditioning, much more easily than the ideas we went to learn. Even if these peripheral details are a bit elusive, they come back readily in hypnosis or when we relive the event imaginatively, as in psychodrama. The details of the content of the lecture, on the other hand, seem to have gone forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This phenomenon can be partly attributed to the common counterproductive approach to study (making extreme efforts to memorise, tensing muscles, inducing fatigue), but it also simply reflects the way the brain functions. Lozanov therefore made indirect instruction (suggestion) central to his teaching system. In suggestopedia, as he called his method, consciousness is shifted away from the curriculum to focus on something peripheral. The curriculum then becomes peripheral and is dealt with by the reserve capacity of the brain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The suggestopedic approach to foreign language learning provides a good illustration. In its most recent variant (1980), it consists of the reading of vocabulary and text while the class is listening to music. The first session is in two parts. In the first part, the music isclassical (Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms) and the teacher reads the text slowly and solemnly, with attention to the dynamics of the music. The students follow the text in their books. This is followed by several minutes of silence. In the second part, they listen to baroque music (Bach, Corelli, Handel) while the teacher reads the text in a normal speaking voice. During this time they have their books closed. During the whole of this session, their attention is passive; they listen to the music but make no attempt to learn the material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beforehand, the students have been carefully prepared for the language learning experience. Through meeting with the staff and satisfied students they develop the expectation that learning will be easy and pleasant and that they will successfully learn several hundred words of the foreign language during the class. In a preliminary talk, the teacher introduces them to the material to be covered, but does not &amp;rsquo;teach&amp;rsquo; it. Likewise, the students are instructed not to try to learn it during this introduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some hours after the two-part session, there is a follow-up class at which the students are stimulated to recall the material presented. Once again the approach is indirect. The students do not focus their attention on trying to remember the vocabulary, but focus on using the language to communicate (e.g. through games or improvised dramatisations). Such methods are not unusual in language teaching. What is distinctive in the suggestopedic method is that they are devoted entirely to assisting recall. The &amp;rsquo;learning&amp;rsquo; of the material is assumed to be automatic and effortless, accomplished while listening to music. The teacher&amp;rsquo;s task is to assist the students to apply what they have learned paraconsciously, and in doing so to make it easily accessible to consciousness. Another difference from conventional teaching is the evidence that students can regularly learn 1000 new words of a foreign language during a suggestopedic session, as well as grammar and idiom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lozanov experimented with teaching by direct suggestion during sleep, hypnosis and trance states, but found such procedures unnecessary. Hypnosis, yoga, Silva mind-control, religious ceremonies and faith healing are all associated with successful suggestion, but none of their techniques seem to be essential to it. Such rituals may be seen as placebos. Lozanov acknowledges that the ritual surrounding suggestion in his own system is also a placebo, but maintains that without such a placebo people are unable or afraid to tap the reserve capacity of their brains. Like any placebo, it must be dispensed with authority to be effective. Just as a doctor calls on the full power of autocratic suggestion by insisting that the patient take precisely this white capsule precisely three times a day before meals, Lozanov is categoric in insisting that the suggestopedic session be conducted exactly in the manner designated, by trained and accredited suggestopedic teachers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While suggestopedia has gained some notoriety through success in the teaching of modern languages, few teachers are able to emulate the spectacular results of Lozanov and his associates. We can, perhaps, attribute mediocre results to an inadequate placebo effect. The students have not developed the appropriate mind set. They are often not motivated to learn through this method. They do not have enough &amp;lsquo;faith&amp;rsquo;. They do not see it as &amp;lsquo;real teaching&amp;rsquo;, especially as it does not seem to involve the &amp;lsquo;work&amp;rsquo; they have learned to believe is essential to learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 4.2.3</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.2.3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 23:01:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.2.3/</guid><description>
&lt;p>W: Oh, there you are, good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorry I&amp;rsquo;m a bit late. There was a long queue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So have you worked out how to deal with this assignment then?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M1: Not yet. We&amp;rsquo;ve only been here a couple of minutes ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Can you just remind me what the task is exactly?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M2: Well, there are two, err, no, three parts to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First we&amp;rsquo;ve got to write an essay about ways of collecting data. Then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: What&amp;rsquo;s the title of the essay exactly?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M1: I&amp;rsquo;ve got it here: &amp;lsquo;Assess the two main methods of collecting data in social science research&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: And how much do we need to write?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M1: Fifteen hundred words. That&amp;rsquo;s for the essay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, for the second part of the assignment, we have to choose one method of data collection, and carry out a small-scale study, making appropriate use of the method chosen to gather data from at least five subjects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: And then we have to write a report on the study?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M2: That&amp;rsquo;s right, of three to four thousand words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Did you get as far as discussing which form of data collection we should go for - questionnaire or interview, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M1: Yeah, I think we should use a questionnaire. It&amp;rsquo;ll be so much less time-consuming than organising interviews, I reckon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once we&amp;rsquo;ve agreed on the wording of it, we only have to send it out and wait for the responses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Yes, I think it probably would be quicker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what did that article he gave us last week say about the quality of data from questionnaires?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M1: I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it recommended questionnaires as a source of &amp;lsquo;highly reliable data&amp;rsquo;. As long as you design the questionnaire properly in the first place, the data will be fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: No. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it talked about drawbacks as well, didn&amp;rsquo;t it? something about the response rate and the problems you get if it&amp;rsquo;s too low.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M1: Yeah, but we only need data from five subjects, anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Oh, I suppose so. Another drawback I remember it mentioned was that questionnaire data tends not to reveal anything unexpected, because it is limited to the questions fixed in advance by the researcher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M1: Come on, Rosa. This is only a practice. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to be a real research, is it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions twenty-seven to thirty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now listen and answer questions twenty-seven to thirty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Maybe I&amp;rsquo;d better go through the article again, just to be sure. Can you remember what it was called?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: &amp;lsquo;Sample Surveys and Social Science Research&amp;rsquo;, I think. By Mehta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: M-E-H-T-A?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yeah. And he also recommended a more recent book called Survey Research by Bell, I think.It&amp;rsquo;s in that series published by London University.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M2: And if we tried to use interviews instead, I saw a book in the departmental library that will be helpful: it&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;lsquo;Interviews that work&amp;rsquo;, by Wilson, published in Oxford in nineteen eighty-eight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Right. Oh, I have got a tutorial now. Can we meet up again later this week?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What about Friday morning?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Suits me. Eleven o&amp;rsquo;clock?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Before Friday, I think we should all look through the reading list.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So far, in these lectures, we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at crimes like robbery and murder - both from a historical viewpoint and also in contemporary society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we&amp;rsquo;ve seen that the preoccupation in Western society with crime and with lawlessness is part of a long and continuous tradition, rather than something which is new and unique to modern society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But over the past seventy years or so, there has been a massive increase in one type of crime which is what&amp;rsquo;s known as &amp;lsquo;corporate crime&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Corporate crime is crime which, as the name suggests, is connected with companies, with business organisations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It includes illegal acts of either individuals or a group within the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what is important is that these acts are normally in accordance with the goals of the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re for the good of the company rather than the individual.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been defined as, quote, &amp;lsquo;crime which is committed for the corporate organization&amp;rsquo; - the company - &amp;rsquo;not against it&amp;rsquo;, unquote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So crimes like theft by employees - things like&amp;hellip;err&amp;hellip;embezzlement or fraud against one&amp;rsquo;s actual employer are excluded according to this definition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The employees may be involved but they&amp;rsquo;re acting in the first place for the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They may not even realize that they are committing a crime, or they may realise but they feel it&amp;rsquo;s excusable because it&amp;rsquo;s policy, or because otherwise they may lose their jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here, really, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the links between power and crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, this is one area that much less is generally known about than conventional or traditional crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been relatively ignored by the mass media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, it tends to be underreported in comparison with conventional crime in news broadcasts, and in crime serials and films and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They very rarely deal with corporate crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it also tends to be ignored in academic circles, there&amp;rsquo;s been far more research on conventional crime and far more data is available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several reasons for this lack of interest in corporate crime, compared with other types of crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s often very complex, whereas with conventional crime, it&amp;rsquo;s usually possible to follow what&amp;rsquo;s going on without specialist knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As well as this, whereas conventional crime usually has a lot of human interest, corporate crime often has much less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third reason, and possibly the most significant one, is that very often the victims are unaware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They think their misfortune is an accident, or that is the fault of no-one in particular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re unaware that they&amp;rsquo;ve been victims of a crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when we look at the effects of corporate crime, we may find it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to assess the costs, but these costs can be very considerable in both their economic and social aspects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the economic costs first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, if a company is producing fruit juice, and it dilutes its product, so that it&amp;rsquo;s just a little below the concentration it should be, many millions of people may be paying a small amount extra​ for their carton of orange juice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now small amounts like this may seem insignificant for individual customers, too small to worry about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But for the company, this deception might result in massive illegal profit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, all studies of corporate crime agree that the individuals are in fact deprived of far more money by such crime than they are by conventional crime like robbery and theft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to this we have to consider the social costs of corporate crime, and these are again very difficult to assess, but they are considerable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re important because they can undermine the faith of the public in the business world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And also, more importantly, because the main group of people they affect are, in fact, not the richer sections of the society but the poorer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here, companies are robbing the poor to benefit the rich.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two more points to do with corporate crime that I&amp;rsquo;d like to illustrate with the reference to a specific event which occurred several years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was an explosion of a large oil tanker which caused the loss of more than fifty lives of the crew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was an explosion which never should have happened, and a subsequent inquiry laid the blame not on anyone who had actually been on the tanker at the time, but on the owners of the tanker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They had deliberately decided not to carry out necessary repair work on the tanker as it was due to be sold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it was this lack of repair work which was directly responsible for the explosion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now this illustrates two points to do with corporate crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, that it does not have to be intentional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The owners of the tanker certainly did not intend it to explode but very serious consequences can result from people or organisations not considering the possible results of their actions seriously enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main crime here was indifference to the human results rather than actual intention to harm anyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that didn&amp;rsquo;t make the results any less tragic. And this leads me to my second point that corporate crime can have very severe consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not just a matter of companies making bigger profits than they should do, but of events which may affect the lives of innocent people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet very often companies, because they say they didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to harm anyone, can avoid taking responsibility for the results of their actions, and that has been a very dangerous loophole in the law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A further example of corporate crime was fade out&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of section four, you now have half a minute to check your answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of the listening test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the IELTS test, you would now have ten minutes to transfer your answers to the listening answer sheet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 4.3.1</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.3.1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 23:01:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.3.1/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Most of them live in flats but that&amp;rsquo;s not a problem for you, is it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S: Not at all. I&amp;rsquo;m used to that. My aunt lives in a flat too, remember?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not used to a big house with a garden, swimming pool, pets and all that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Okay fine. I know quite a bit about what you want now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I should let you know that your rent will be 160 dollars per week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay me 320 dollars as a deposit before you move in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The deposit is as insurance in case you break something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to pay monthly to me by cash or cheque, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don&amp;rsquo;t need to pay for gas, electricity or water. But you&amp;rsquo;ll need to pay your proportion of the phone bill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most families do that on an honor system but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>En, Have you got any more questions for me?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>S: When will you know where I can go?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: I&amp;rsquo;ll work on it now. So come and see me tomorrow and I should have some news for you then.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Officer: Hello. Er, I&amp;rsquo;m Dawn Matthews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Yes, hello. I&amp;rsquo;ve been referred to you because I&amp;rsquo;m enquiring about the refresher courses that you run. I&amp;rsquo;d like to find out a bit more about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: OK. Well, we run quite a few different short courses for students who are either returning to study or studying part-time. Um, tell me about your situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Well, I think that I really need some help in preparing for the coming semester, especially to build up my confidence a bit and help me study effectively because you see, I&amp;rsquo;ve been out in the work-force for nearly twelve years now, so it really is a long time since I was last a student.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Yes, it can seem like a long time, can&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Um, well, let me start by telling you what courses we have that might suit you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are you an undergraduate or a postgraduate? Arts or Sciences?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Undergraduate, and I&amp;rsquo;m in the business faculty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Right then. First of all, there&amp;rsquo;s our intensive &amp;lsquo;Study for Success&amp;rsquo; seminar on the first and second of February.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s aimed at students like you who are uncertain about what to expect at college, and looks at a fairly wide range of approaches to university learning, to motivate you to begin your study and build on your own learning strategies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Mm, that sounds good. Um, what&amp;rsquo;re some of the strategies that are presented?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Well, we try to cover all aspects of study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the strategies in writing, for example, would be improving your planning for writing, organizing your thinking and building some techniques to help you write more clearly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With reading, there will be sessions aimed at getting into the habit of analysing material as you read it, and tips to help you record and remember what you&amp;rsquo;ve read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It really is very important to begin reading confidently right from the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: There&amp;rsquo;s also advice on how to get the most from your lectures and practice in giving confident presentations as well as how to prepare for exams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: What about the motivational side of things?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Ah, well, there&amp;rsquo;s a range of motivational exercises that we do to help the students feel positive and enthusiastic about their study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process of learning and exploring a subject can lead to a whole new way of looking at the world and the study skills and techniques you build up can be applied in all sorts of different ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Actually, I&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about the whole thing of taking up study again but, you know, I&amp;rsquo;m a little nervous about whether I&amp;rsquo;ll manage to get everything done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Er, I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s the same for all mature students?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Of course, it is. Two of the key components of the course are time management and overcoming procrastination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People discover that, once they learn to plan their days, all the work can be accomplished and there&amp;rsquo;ll still be time for leisure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Is there an enrolment fee?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Well, er, oh, just a minute, let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;Ah, the cost is 30 pounds, which includes all course materials and morning tea. You have to arrange your own lunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Em, that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. Er, I already make sandwiches for my three kids and my wife and myself everyday. I won&amp;rsquo;t have to change my routine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: No. Now, I need to tell you that this is a very popular course and it&amp;rsquo;s essential that you book well ahead of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, the Course Convenor tells me that there&amp;rsquo;re only five places left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Er, what other course might be good for me?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: There&amp;rsquo;s one other that you could benefit from. It&amp;rsquo;s simply called &amp;lsquo;Learning Skills for University Study&amp;rsquo; and is on three consecutive mornings starting on a Monday from 9 to 12 and costs 25 pounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is aimed at upgrading the study skills most school-leavers have and help them cope with the increased demands of university study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It focuses mainly on making students more responsible for their own success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: What sort of things are covered in this course?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Well, basically, it&amp;rsquo;s more advanced thinking, note taking, reading and writing strategies but also some input about stress management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: Um, I think I&amp;rsquo;d be better off starting from the basics and looking at all the strategies, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Yes, from what you&amp;rsquo;ve told me, I think that&amp;rsquo;s more in line with your situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Student: All right then, um, can I book a place on the &amp;lsquo;Study for Success&amp;rsquo; seminar course now?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Officer: Yes, let me just get out a registration form and take down your details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of section three. You now have half a minute to check your answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now turn to section four.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 4.3.4</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.3.4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 23:01:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.3.4/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re very grateful that the Committee has agreed that a representative for the Students&amp;rsquo; Union can present students&amp;rsquo; suggestions about the design for the proposed new Union Building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We appreciate that some of our ideas may not be feasible in the circumstances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we do feel that it is important that the ultimate beneficiaries of the facilities should have some say in its design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I could start by briefly explaining what steps were taken to find out student opinion, and how we have arrived at conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, a meeting was held in the current Union for our SU committee to explain the options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we invited all students to submit written suggestions for the design, placing cards in a suggestion box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These suggestions then provided the basis for the design of a questionnaire which was completed by approximately two thousand of the College students over a period of three weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the SU Committee collated the results and drew up a report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I can just hand around the copy of that report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation is essentially a summary and discussion of the key points of this report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in broad terms, the consensus was as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, regarding the crucial matter of the site, we presented the three options that you have proposed. One: in the city centre, near the Faculty of Education; two: on the outskirts of the city, near the park, and three: out of town, near the halls of residence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ask students to cite reasons for and against these sites, and&amp;hellip;. and there was remarkable agreement on all three.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Site One was unpopular because of traffic and parking problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Site Two had a number of supporters, mainly because it was close to most lecture rooms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Site Three, out of town, near the halls of residence, was clearly the most popular because of access from living quarters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was clear that the Union was mainly to be used after lectures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was also felt the larger site would allow more room for a choice of facilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our second area of interest was obviously the facilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was minimal interest in having a library on the premises. But one option seemed to be a reading room instead, more useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We would like the current table games room to be replaced with a small gym and if possible, small swimming pool, not, of course, Olympic size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a large number of respondents in favour of a travel agent&amp;rsquo;s and insurance centre.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also request that there be the offices of the Student Counselling Centre, moving this from the Refectory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was however much disagreement about whether to build a drama theatre.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just over forty percent of the respondents were in favour, but a largish minority were strongly against it, claiming that it is elitist and a waste of funds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essentially the jury is out on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, given the number of unfortunate incidents in the current Union over the past few months, a strong point was repeatedly made about security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The recommendations would be at least video surveillance and security personnel who would check Student Union cards on request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We doubt if it would be feasible to have a check at reception of all people coming in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, this is the summary of the views of the student population.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I say, fuller details are given in our report but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to take any questions if you have them&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of section four, you now have half a minute to check your answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of the listening test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the IELTS test, you would now have ten minutes to transfer your answers to the listening answer sheet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 4.4.1</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.4.1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 23:01:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.4.1/</guid><description>
&lt;p>W: Hi, Tony. Thanks ever so much for coming. You know we&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to organise something for John&amp;rsquo;s farewell?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yeah, sure. It&amp;rsquo;s about time we started working out details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Exactly. We don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave it so late that it&amp;rsquo;s double the work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Mmm, mm, right, do you want me to take notes?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: That&amp;rsquo;d be great, thanks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Right, first thing is when is the best time to hold it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Well, he leaves on the twenty-fourth of December. -M: So what about the twenty-second?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Yeah, I think that&amp;rsquo;s about right. We want it quite near the time, don&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The date of the goodbye party is the 22nd of December, so 22nd December has been written in the space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we shall begin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should answer the questions as you listen, because you will not hear the recording a second time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Hi, Tony. Thanks ever so much for coming. You know we&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to organise something for John&amp;rsquo;s farewell?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yes, sure. It&amp;rsquo;s about time we started working out details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Exactly, We don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave it so late that it&amp;rsquo;s double the work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Em, right. Do you want me to take notes? -W: That will be great. Thanks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Right, first thing is when is the best time to hold it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Well, he leaves on the twenty-fourth of December. -M: So what about the twenty-second?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Yeah, I think that&amp;rsquo;s about right. We want it quite near the time, don&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Sure, and what about a venue? In college? A hotel?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: I think a hotel will probably work out rather expensive and I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at the College Dining Room: that seems pretty reasonable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Fine, yeah, why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: And then we ought to be thinking about invitations&amp;hellip;Who mustn&amp;rsquo;t we forget to invite?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Well, obviously, John and his wife.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: And the Director. The office staff. -W: Ah ha. Yep, and all the teachers and all the students?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Anyone else?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Faculty Heads?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: No, better draw the line, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Yeah, you&amp;rsquo;re right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: I don&amp;rsquo;t mind writing the invitations. When shall we get them out for?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Em, enough time, but not too early. What about the fifteenth of December?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Well, there are exams on the sixteenth, better avoid them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Em, tenth?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yeah, that should do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you hear the rest of the conversation you&amp;rsquo;ll have some time to look at questions 5 to 10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now listen, and answer questions 5 to 10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: So, what does that leave? Oh, yes, a present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Em, would you mind doing that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: No, not at all; we usually go round with an envelope during coffee break, don&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yeah, coffee break&amp;rsquo;s always the best time, cos people have got their money handy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Yeah, exactly. Do we suggest an amount? Or does it seem a bit unfair?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: No, I think people welcome it. We suggested six dollars last time. Is that Ok?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Yeah, plenty I would have thought, which should leave us with about ninety dollars?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Em, have you any ideas for presents?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a little think. I thought, you know, he loves music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Em, yeah, and books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: So, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d check on prices for, well, perhaps CD players?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Em, yeah. That&amp;rsquo;s a good idea and also I thought maybe, you know, a set of dictionaries. I heard him say he needed a good one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: The other thing he was saying last week was that his computer printer had broken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Umm. No, I&amp;rsquo;d be really frightened about getting the wrong type.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Ok, yeah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: The other thing is something for the home. Jill suggested a coffee maker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Oh, yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly find out what they cost. Ok, have you got all that down?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Now, we need to think a little more about the money. I know we&amp;rsquo;ve got a set amount from the Social Fund.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Right, what does that cover?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: It&amp;rsquo;s meant to cover the cost of the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yeah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: And a certain amount for food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: And also drinks?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Oh yeah, certainly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: But will it be enough?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: What we&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past is to ask guests to bring some snacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: We don&amp;rsquo;t ask them to bring more drinks, because we figure that&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip;that should come from the Social Fund.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Ok. Anything else for the guests to bring?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Well, oh some music, because there&amp;rsquo;ll be a tape deck there in the room, and we can have some dancing later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Anything else?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Well, it&amp;rsquo;s just a thought, but a couple of years ago, that we had a really good party where we set up, you know, some simple games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yeah, great. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t it based on photos from the students and teachers?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: That&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: So we should ask the guests to bring photos. Ok, I&amp;rsquo;ll put it on the invitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Now the last thing is, who shall we ask to do the speech?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Don&amp;rsquo;t you think it might be nice to have one of the students?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Well then, the Student Leader?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Yeah, much better than the Director giving speeches again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Ok then, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask her. Lovely, so is that all?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>M: Looks like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>W: Great. Thanks ever so much.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MIKE: Hi Sue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Hi Mike, so what happened to you last week?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Oh, I was sick with the flu. What&amp;rsquo;s this I hear about a big assignment we&amp;rsquo;ve got to do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Well, basically, we&amp;rsquo;ve got to find two science experiments to do with a group of eight-year-old children at the local primary school, and we&amp;rsquo;ve got to complete it by the end of the week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Oh, that sounds like hard work. Where are we supposed to get the ideas for these experiments from?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Well, I managed to get hold of two books from the library.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Oh, well done!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: How about if we take a look at the experiments in this book first and see if anything looks suitable?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can make notes as we go, about equipment and the purpose of the experiments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: OK, let&amp;rsquo;s see, um, the first experiment is called &amp;lsquo;Make your own hovercraft &amp;lsquo;, which sounds very ambitious!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mind you, you only need twenty balloons and a table-you don&amp;rsquo;t need any special engines or anything like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: What do you do with it all?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Er, you blow up the balloons and you balance the table on them, upside down of course, and the kids get to ride around on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know, the other kids sort of push them around the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main purpose is to show how hovercrafts work, and how things hover around on just a cushion of air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: OK, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound too bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: OK, ready for number two?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Uh-huh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Now this one is called &amp;lsquo;Unusual Measures of Lengths&amp;rsquo;, and you basically use lots of paperclips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The kids go around the class measuring things - you know, how long the desk is, and that sort of thing, um, and then they all compare their answers, Er, and, basically, because not all paperclips are the same lengths, they should come up with some strange answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to demonstrate the importance of having fixed units of measurement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Hmm, yes, that&amp;rsquo;s not bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: OK, now for number three you need rock salt or copper sulphate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Well, just put down the rock salt then. Um, apart from that you only need a jar of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Um, and basically you dissolve lots of salt into the water and watch the crystals form, so it basically teaches the kids about growing crystals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Yeah, I suppose it would be nice to grow something. Hmm, let&amp;rsquo;s move on and have a look at number four.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: OK, this one is called &amp;lsquo;Spinning colour wheel&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It looks like you get some cardboard and draw a circle on it, divide it into six equal segments and colour each one in using different colours, then you thread a piece of string through the middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: So we&amp;rsquo;d need some string as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Yes, sorry&amp;hellip;um&amp;hellip;and you spin the wheel around and if you can get it spinning fast enough, hopefully the colours all merge and show up as white.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Oh, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that. What&amp;rsquo;s the principle behind it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Well it&amp;rsquo;s pretty elementary physics, really. It teaches them about how white light or ordinary light is made up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Hmm, well that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound too bad. Now there&amp;rsquo;s only one more left in this book, isn&amp;rsquo;t there? What does that one say?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Um, well it&amp;rsquo;s another one where they&amp;rsquo;d get to make something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Sounds very interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: You need quite a lot of equipment actually -a hand drill, an old record, a pin or needle, some paper and a bolt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Hmm, go on, what do they have to do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Well, they basically make a record player. The main idea is to teach them about recording sound, but hopefully they&amp;rsquo;d also see that you need motion and an amplifier to make the sound heard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: OK, well it does sound interesting. Shall we go through all of those again and decide if any of them are going to be suitable?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 27 to 30.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now listen and answer questions 27 to 30.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Right, number one. I thought this one sounded nice: there&amp;rsquo;d be lots of activity and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need too much in the way of equipment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s true. But don&amp;rsquo;t you think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit risky to get a group of eight-year-olds pushing each other around a classroom like that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Someone could get hurt. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t like the sound of that one at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: What about number two, with the paperclips? It sounds tame enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Yes, a bit too tame if you ask me. I think it needs to be something a bit more active and interesting than that, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Yes, I suppose you&amp;rsquo;re right. We won&amp;rsquo;t get a very good mark if the children don&amp;rsquo;t actually enjoy the experiments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I suppose we could turn them off science for good! Well, what about the next one, number three?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Now, I quite like the idea of this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Yes, so do I, but I seem to remember when we did it at high school we had to wait up to a fortnight before we saw any halfway decent results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Oh, yes. Well, that won&amp;rsquo;t be any good then. We&amp;rsquo;ll only see the kids for one or two hours at the most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Yes, and we have to do the experiments and write up our results within a week, so that one won&amp;rsquo;t do at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: OK, well, what did you think of number four?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: I like the idea of it. But do you think it will be a bit elementary for them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Well, they are only eight you know!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: I know, but you know what I mean. Don&amp;rsquo;t you think the activity itself is a bit babyish?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Hmm, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: They might have fun but, I mean, cutting out a circle and colouring it in?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: OK, well, what about number five?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: I thought this one sounded a bit too good to be true-great equipment!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: Yeah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: But don&amp;rsquo;t you think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit ambitious for this age group?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to start off something and then have to abandon it if they just can&amp;rsquo;t cope with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could see us ending up doing just about all of the work for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIKE: I guess you&amp;rsquo;re right. Oh well, maybe we could store that idea away for later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SUE: Yep, let&amp;rsquo;s hope this second book has something better!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of section three. You now have half a minute to check your answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now turn to section four.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 4.4.4</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.4.4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 23:01:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.4.4/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Today we are going to look at one of my favourite fish -the shark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you know, sharks have a reputation for being very dangerous creatures capable of injuring or killing humans, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about sharks in Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sharks are rather large fish, often growing to over ten metres and the longest sharks caught in Australia have reached sixteen metres.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sharks vary in weight with size and breed, of course, but the heaviest shark caught in Australia was a White Pointer -that weighed seven hundred and ninety-five kilograms-quite a size!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sharks have a different structure to most fish: instead of skeleton made of bone, they have a tough elastic skeleton of cartilage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike bone, this firm, pliable material is rather like your nose, and allows the shark to bend easily as it swims.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shark&amp;rsquo;s skin isn&amp;rsquo;t covered with scales, like other fish: instead the skin&amp;rsquo;s covered with barbs, giving it a rough texture like sandpaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you know​, sharks are very quick swimmers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is made possible by their fins, one set at the side and another set underneath the body, and the tail also helps the shark move forward quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike other fish, sharks have to keep swimming if they want to stay at a particular depth, and they rarely swim at the surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mostly, they swim at the bottom of the ocean, scavenging and picking up food that&amp;rsquo;s lying on the ocean floor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While most other animals, including fish, hunt their prey by means of their eyesight, sharks hunt essentially by smell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They have a very acute sense of smell-and can sense the presence of food long before they can see it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Australia, where people spend a lot of time at the beach, the government has realised that it must prevent sharks from swimming near its beaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, they have introduced a beach-netting program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beach-netting, or meshing, involves setting large nets parallel to the shore; this means that the nets on New South Wale beaches are set on one day, and then lifted and taken out to sea on the next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When shark-netting first began in 1939, only the sydney metropolitan beaches were meshed, these beaches were chosen because beaches near the city are usually the most crowded with swimmers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ten years later, in 1949, systematic meshing was extended to include the beaches to the south of Sydney.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result of the general success of the program in Sydney, shark-meshing was introduced to the state of Queensland around 1970.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The New Zealand authorities also looked at it, but considered meshing uneconomical - as did Tahiti in the Pacific.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At around the same time, South Africa introduced meshing to some of its most popular swimming beaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When meshing began, approximately fifteen hundred sharks were caught in the first year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this declined in the year that followed, and since that time, the average annual catch has been only about a hundred and fifty a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The majority of sharks are caught during the warmest months, from November to February, when sharks are most active and when both the air and the ocean are at their maximum temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite quite large catches, some people believe that the shark meshing is not the best way to catch sharks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not that they think sharks are afraid of nets, or because they eat holes in them, because neither of these is true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But meshing does appear to be less effective than some other methods, especially when there are big seas with high rolling waves and strong currents and anything that lets the sand move - the sand that&amp;rsquo;s holding the nets down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When this moves the nets will also become less effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of section four, you now have half a minute to check your answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of the listening test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the IELTS test, you would now have ten minutes to transfer your answers to the listening answer sheet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R6.1.1 AUSTRALIA’S SPORTING SUCCESS</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r6.1.1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 15:59:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r6.1.1/</guid><description>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>They play hard, they play often, and they play to win. Australian sports teams win more than their fair share of titles, demolishing rivals with seeming ease. How do they do it? A big part of the secret is an extensive and expensive network of sporting academies underpinned by science and medicine. At the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), hundreds of youngsters and pros live and train under the eyes of coaches. Another body, the Australian Sports Commission (ASC), finances programmes of excellence in a total of 96 sports for thousands of sportsmen and women. Both provide intensive coaching, training facilities and nutritional advice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Inside the academies, science takes centre stage.The AIS employs more than 100 sports scientists and doctors, and collaborates with scores of others in universities and research centres. AIS scientists work across a number of sports, applying skills learned in one - such as building muscle strength in golfers - to others, such as swimming and squash.They are backed up by technicians who design instruments to collect data from athletes.They all focus on one aim: winning.‘We can&amp;rsquo;t waste our time looking at ethereal scientific questions that don&amp;rsquo;t help the coach work with an athlete and improve performance,’ says Peter Fricker; chief of science at AIS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A lot of their work comes down to measurement - everything from the exact angle of a swimmer&amp;rsquo;s dive to the second-by-second power output of a cyclist.This data is used to wring improvements out of athletes.The focus is on individuals, tweaking performances to squeeze an extra hundredth of a second here, an extra millimetre there. No gain is too slight to bother with. It&amp;rsquo;s the tiny, gradual improvements that add up to world-beating results.To demonstrate how the system works, Bruce Mason at AJ$ shows off the prototype of a 3D analysis tool for studying swimmers. A wire-frame model of a champion swimmer slices through the water , her arms moving in slow motion. Looking side-on, Mason measures the distance between strokes. From above, he analyses how her spine swivels. When fully developed, this system will enable him to build a biomechanical profile for coaches to use to help budding swimmers. Mason&amp;rsquo;s contribution to sport also includes the development of the SWAN (SWimming ANalysis) system now used in Australian national competitions. It collects images from digital cameras running at 50 frames a second and breaks down each part of a swimmer&amp;rsquo;s performance into factors that can be analysed individually - stroke length, stroke frequency, average duration of each stroke, velocity, start, lap and finish times, and so on. At the end of each race, SWAN spits out data on each swimmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>‘Take a look,&amp;rsquo; says Mason, pulling out a sheet of data. He points out the data on the swimmers in second and third place, which shows that the one who finished third actually swam faster. So why did he finish 35 hundredths of a second down? ‘His turn times were 44 hundredths of a second behind the other guy,’ says Mason.&amp;lsquo;If he can improve on his turns, he can do much better&amp;rsquo;This is the kind of accuracy that AIS scientists’ research is bringing to a range of sports. With the Cooperative Research Centre for Micro Technology in Melbourne, they are developing unobtrusive sensors that will be embedded in an athlete&amp;rsquo;s clothes or running shoes to monitor heart rate, sweating, heat production or any other factor that might have an impact on an athlete’s ability to run.There&amp;rsquo;s more to it than simply measuring performance. Fricker gives the example of athletes who may be down with coughs and colds 11 or 12 times a year. After years of experimentation, AIS and the University of Newcastle in New South Wales developed a test that measures how much of the immune-system protein immunoglobulin A is present in athletes&amp;rsquo; saliva. If IgA levels suddenly fall below a certain level, training is eased or dropped altogether. Soon, IgA levels start rising again, and the danger passes. Since the tests were introduced, AIS athletes in all sports have been remarkably successful at staying healthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Using data is a complex business. Well before a championship, sports scientists and coaches start to prepare the athlete by developing a &amp;lsquo;competition model’, based on what they expect will be the winning times.&amp;lsquo;You design the model to make that time,&amp;rsquo; says Mason.&amp;lsquo;A start of this much, each free-swimming period has to be this fast, with a certain stroke frequency and stroke length, with turns done in these times.’All the training is then geared towards making the athlete hit those targets, both overall and for each segment of the race.Techniques like these have transformed Australia into arguably the world’s most successful sporting nation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to stop other countries copying - and many have tried. Some years ago, the AIS unveiled coolant-lined jackets for endurance athletes. At the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, these sliced as much as two per cent off cyclists&amp;rsquo; and rowers’ times. Now everyone uses them.The same has happened to the &amp;lsquo;altitude tent’, developed by AIS to replicate the effect of altitude training at sea level. But Australia&amp;rsquo;s success story is about more than easily copied technological fixes, and up to now no nation has replicated its all-encompassing system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R6.1.2 DELIVERING THE GOODS</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r6.1.2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 15:59:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r6.1.2/</guid><description>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The vast expansion in international trade owes much to a revolution in the business of moving freight&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>International trade is growing at a startling pace. While the global economy has been expanding at a bit over 3% a year, the volume of trade has been rising at a compound annual rate of about twice that. Foreign products, from meat to machinery, play a more important role in almost every economy in the world, and foreign markets now tempt businesses that never much worried about sales beyond their nation’s borders.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What lies behind this explosion in international commerce? The general worldwide decline in trade barriers, such as customs duties and import quotas, is surely one explanation. The economic opening of countries that have traditionally been minor players is another. But one force behind the import-export boom has passed all but unnoticed: the rapidly falling cost of getting goods to market. Theoretically, in the world of trade, shipping costs do not matter. Goods, once they have been made, are assumed to move instantly and at no cost from place to place. The real world, however, is full of frictions. Cheap labour may make Chinese clothing competitive in America, but if delays in shipment tie up working capital and cause winter coats to arrive in spring, trade may lose its advantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and manufacturing were the two most important sectors almost everywhere, accounting for about 70% of total output in Germany, Italy and France, and 40-50% in America, Britain and Japan. International commerce was therefore dominated by raw materials, such as wheat, wood and iron ore, or processed commodities, such as meat and steel. But these sorts of products are heavy and bulky and the cost of transporting them relatively high.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Countries still trade disproportionately with their geographic neighbours. Over time, however, world output has shifted into goods whose worth is unrelated to their size and weight. Today, it is finished manufactured products that dominate the flow of trade, and, thanks to technological advances such as lightweight components, manufactured goods themselves have tended to become lighter and less bulky. As a result, less transportation is required for every dollar’s worth of imports or exports.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>To see how this influences trade, consider the business of making disk drives for computers. Most of the world’s disk-drive manufacturing is concentrated in South-east Asia. This is possible only because disk drives, while valuable, are small and light and so cost little to ship. Computer manufacturers in Japan or Texas will not face hugely bigger freight bills if they import drives from Singapore rather than purchasing them on the domestic market. Distance therefore poses no obstacle to the globalisation of the disk-drive industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is even more true of the fast-growing information industries. Films and compact discs cost little to transport, even by aeroplane. Computer software can be ‘exported’ without ever loading it onto a ship, simply by transmitting it over telephone lines from one country to another, so freight rates and cargo-handling schedules become insignificant factors in deciding where to make the product. Businesses can locate based on other considerations, such as the availability of labour, while worrying less about the cost of delivering their output.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="g">G&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In many countries deregulation has helped to drive the process along. But, behind the scenes, a series of technological innovations known broadly as containerisation and inter- modal transportation has led to swift productivity improvements in cargo-handling. Forty years ago, the process of exporting or importing involved a great many stages of handling, which risked portions of the shipment being damaged or stolen along the way. The invention of the container crane made it possible to load and unload containers without capsizing the ship and the adoption of standard container sizes allowed almost any box to be transported on any ship. By 1967, dual-purpose ships, carrying loose cargo in the hold* and containers on the deck, were giving way to all-container vessels that moved thousands of boxes at a time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="h">H&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The shipping container transformed ocean shipping into a highly efficient, intensely competitive business. But getting the cargo to and from the dock was a different story. National governments, by and large, kept a much firmer hand on truck and railroad tariffs than on charges for ocean freight. This started changing, however, in the mid-1970s, when America began to deregulate its transportation industry. First airlines, then road hauliers and railways, were freed from restrictions on what they could carry, where they could haul it and what price they could charge. Big productivity gains resulted. Between 1985 and 1996, for example, America’s freight railways dramatically reduced their employment, trackage, and their fleets of locomotives - while increasing the amount of cargo they hauled. Europe’s railways have also shown marked, albeit smaller, productivity improvements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="i">I&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In America the period of huge productivity gains in transportation may be almost over, but in most countries the process still has far to go. State ownership of railways and airlines, regulation of freight rates and toleration of anti-competitive practices, such as cargo-handling monopolies, all keep the cost of shipping unnecessarily high and deter international trade. Bringing these barriers down would help the world’s economies grow even closer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R6.1.3 Climate Change and the Inuit</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r6.1.3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 15:59:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r6.1.3/</guid><description>

&lt;p>The threat posed by climate change in the Arctic and the problems faced by Canada’s Inuit people&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Unusual incidents are being reported across the Arctic. Inuit families going off on snowmobiles to prepare their summer hunting camps have found themselves cut off from home by a sea of mud, following early thaws. There are reports of igloos losing their insulating properties as the snow drips and refreezes, of lakes draining into the sea as permafrost melts, and sea ice breaking up earlier than usual, carrying seals beyond the reach of hunters. Climate change may still be a rather abstract idea to most of us, but in the Arctic it is already having dramatic effects - if summertime ice continues to shrink at its present rate, the Arctic Ocean could soon become virtually ice-free in summer. The knock-on effects are likely to include more warming, cloudier skies, increased precipitation and higher sea levels. Scientists are increasingly keen to find out what&amp;rsquo;s going on because they consider the Arctic the &amp;lsquo;canary in the mine&amp;rsquo; for global warming - a warning of what&amp;rsquo;s in store for the rest of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For the Inuit the problem is urgent. They live in precarious balance with one of the toughest environments on earth. Climate change, whatever its causes, is a direct threat to their way of life. Nobody knows the Arctic as well as the locals, which is why they are not content simply to stand back and let outside experts tell them what&amp;rsquo;s happening. In Canada, where the Inuit people are jealously guarding their hard-won autonomy in the country&amp;rsquo;s newest territory, Nunavut, they believe their best hope of survival in this changing environment lies in combining their ancestral knowledge with the best of modern science. This is a challenge in itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The Canadian Arctic is a vast, treeless polar desert that&amp;rsquo;s covered with snow for most of the year. Venture into this terrain and you get some idea of the hardships facing anyone who calls this home. Farming is out of the question and nature offers meagre pickings. Humans first settled in the Arctic a mere 4,500 years ago, surviving by exploiting sea mammals and fish. The environment tested them to the limits: sometimes the colonists were successful, sometimes they failed and vanished. But around a thousand years ago, one group emerged that was uniquely well adapted to cope with the Arctic environment. These Thule people moved in from Alaska, bringing kayaks, sleds, dogs, pottery and iron tools. They are the ancestors of today&amp;rsquo;s Inuit people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Life for the descendants of the Thule people is still harsh. Nunavut is 1.9 million square kilometres of rock and ice, and a handful of islands around the North Pole. It’s currently home to 2,500 people, all but a handful of them indigenous Inuit. Over the past 40 years, most have abandoned their nomadic ways and settled in the territory&amp;rsquo;s 28 isolated communities, but they still rely heavily on nature to provide food and clothing.
Provisions available in local shops have to be flown into Nunavut on one of the most costly air networks in the world, or brought by supply ship during the few ice-free weeks of summer. It would cost a family around £7,000 a year to replace meat they obtained themselves through hunting with imported meat. Economic opportunities are scarce, and for many people state benefits are their only income.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>While the Inuit may not actually starve if hunting and trapping are curtailed by climate change, there has certainly been an impact on people&amp;rsquo;s health. Obesity, heart disease and diabetes are beginning to appear in a people for whom these have never before been problems. There has been a crisis of identity as the traditional skills of hunting, trapping and preparing skins have begun to disappear. In Nunavut&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;igloo and email&amp;rsquo; society, where adults who were born in igloos have children who may never have been out on the land, there&amp;rsquo;s a high incidence of depression.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>With so much at stake, the Inuit are determined to play a key role in teasing out the mysteries of climate change in the Arctic. Having survived there for centuries, they believe their wealth of traditional knowledge is vital to the task. And Western scientists are starting to draw on this wisdom, increasingly referred to as &amp;lsquo;Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit&amp;rsquo;, or IQ. &amp;lsquo;In the early days scientists ignored us when they came up here to study anything. They just figured these people don&amp;rsquo;t know very much so we won&amp;rsquo;t ask them,&amp;rsquo; says John Amagoalik, an Inuit leader and politician. &amp;lsquo;But in recent years IQ has had much more credibility and weight.&amp;rsquo; In fact it is now a requirement for anyone hoping to get permission to do research that they consult the communities, who are helping to set the research agenda to reflect their most important concerns. They can turn down applications from scientists they believe will work against their interests, or research projects that will impinge too much on their daily lives and traditional activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="g">G&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Some scientists doubt the value of traditional knowledge because the occupation of the Arctic doesn&amp;rsquo;t go back far enough. Others, however, point out that the first weather stations in the far north date back just 50 years. There are still huge gaps in our environmental knowledge, and despite the scientific onslaught, many predictions are no more than best guesses. IQ could help to bridge the gap and resolve the tremendous uncertainty about how much of what we&amp;rsquo;re seeing is natural capriciousness and how much is the consequence of human activity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 1.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tent to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Internet</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/internet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 10:01:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/internet/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Although more and more people read news on the Internet, newspapers will remain the most important source of news. Do you agree or disagree?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>范文:
The Internet is beginning to rival newspapers as the best place to find information about what is happening in the world. I believe that this trend will continue, and the Internet will soon be just as important as the traditional press.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one hand, I believe that newspapers will continue to be a vital source of information, even in the Internet age. Firstly, newspapers are the most traditional means of communicating the news, and not everyone wants to or is able to use the Internet instead. For example, old people or those in rural areas might not have the ability or opportunity to get online, while many of us simply prefer newspapers even if we do have Internet access. Secondly, newspapers can be trusted as reliable sources of news because they employ professional journalists and editors. Finally, many people like the experience of holding and reading a paper rather than looking at a computer screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the Internet is likely to become just as popular as newspapers for a variety of reasons. The main reason is that it allows us much faster access to news in real time and wherever we are, on different gadgets and mobile devices. Another key benefit of online news compared to newspapers is the ability to share articles, discuss them with other people, give our views, and even contribute with our own updates on social media. For example, there has been an explosion in the use of platforms like Twitter and YouTube where anyone can share their news and views. A final point is that this source of news is less damaging to the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, I disagree with the view that newspapers will continue to be the main source of news, because I believe that the Internet will soon be equally important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>练习:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the development of technology, People can easily access the Internet to find information about what is happening in the world using their smartphones or computers, rather than read the newspaper. I believe that the Internet will finally replace the traditional newspaper in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of reading the newspaper, people now can easily use their laptops or smartphones to access the Internet and find out what is happening in the world. I think that eventually, the traditional newspaper will be replaced by tthe Internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, I disagree with the view that newspapers could still remain its importance with the impact of the development of the Internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Phones</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/phones/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 10:01:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/phones/</guid><description>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Some people believe that technological developments lead to the loss of traditional cultures. I partly agree with this assertion;while it may be true in the case of some societies, others seem to be unaffected by technology and the modern world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one hand, the advances in technology that have driven industrialisation in developed countries have certainly contributed to the disappearance of traditional ways of life. For example, in pre-industrial Britain, generations of families grew up in the same small village communities. These communities had a strong sense of identity, due to their shared customs and beliefs. However, developments in transport, communications and manufacturing led to the dispersal of families and village communities as people moved to the cities in search of work. Nowadays most British villages are inhabited by commuters, many of whom do not know their closest neighbours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, in some parts of the world traditional cultures still thrive. There are tribes in the Amazon Rainforest, for example, that have been completely untouched by the technological developments of the developed world. These tribal communities continue to hunt and gather food from the forest, and traditional skills are passed on to children by parents and elders. Other traditional cultures, such as farming communities in parts of Africa, are embracing communications technologies. Mobile phones give farmers access to information, from weather predictions to market prices, which helps them to prosper and therefore supports their culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, many traditional ways of life have been lost as a result of advances in technology, but other traditional communities have survived and even flourished.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Traditional festivals</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/traditional/festivals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 10:01:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/traditional/festivals/</guid><description>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Some people argue that we no longer remember the original meaning of festivals, and that most of us treat them as opportunities to have fun. While I agree that enjoyment seems to be the priority during festival times, I do not agree that people have forgotten what these festivals mean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one hand, religious and traditional festivals have certainly become times for celebration. In the UK, Christmas is a good example of a festival period when people are most concerned with shopping, giving and receiving presents, decorating their homes and enjoying traditional meals with their families. Most people look forward to Christmas as a holiday period, rather than a time to practise religion. Similar behaviour can be seen during non-religious festivals, such as Bonfire Night. People associate this occasion with making fires, watching firework displays, and perhaps going to large events in local parks; in other words, enjoyment is people’s primary goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I disagree with the idea that the underlying meaning of such festivals has been forgotten. In UK primary schools, children learn in detail about the religious reasons for celebrating Christmas, Easter and a variety of festivals in other religions. For example, in late December, children sing Christmas songs which have a religious content, and they may even perform nativity plays telling the story of Jesus’ birth. Families also play a role in passing knowledge of religious festivals’ deeper significance on to the next generation. The same is true for festivals that have a historical background, such as Bonfire Night or Halloween, in the sense that people generally learn the stories behind these occasions at an early age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, although people mainly want to enjoy themselves during festivals, I believe that they are still aware of the reasons for these celebrations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Traditional ideas and younger generations</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/traditional/ideas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 10:01:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/traditional/ideas/</guid><description>

&lt;p>The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is true that many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatible with the needs of younger people. While I agree that some traditional ideas are outdated, I believe that others are still useful and should not be forgotten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one hand, many of the ideas that elderly people have about life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a profession and find a secure job for life, but today’s workers expect much more variety and diversity from their careers. At the same time, the ‘rules’ around relationships are being eroded as young adults make their own choices about who and when to marry. But perhaps the greatest disparity between the generations can be seen in their attitudes towards gender roles. The traditional roles of men and women, as breadwinners and housewives, are no longer accepted as necessary or appropriate by most younger people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, some traditional views and values are certainly applicable to the modern world. For example, older generations attach great importance to working hard, doing one’s best, and taking pride in one’s work, and these behaviours can surely benefit young people as they enter today’s competitive job market. Other characteristics that are perhaps seen as traditional are politeness and good manners. In our globalized world, young adults can expect to come into contact with people from a huge variety of backgrounds, and it is more important than ever to treat others with respect. Finally, I believe that young people would lead happier lives if they had a more “old-fashioned” sense of community and neighborliness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, although the views of older people may sometimes seem unhelpful in today’s world, we should not dismiss all traditional ideas as irrelevant.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: Traditional music vs international music</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/traditional/music/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 10:01:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/docs/2022/08/ielts/writing/traditional/music/</guid><description>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There are many different types of music in the world today. Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Music is something that accompanies all of us throughout our lives. As children, we are taught songs by our parents and teachers as a means of learning language, or simply as a form of enjoyment. Children delight in singing with others, and it would appear that the act of singing in a group creates a connection between participants, regardless of their age. Later in life, people’s musical preferences develop, and we come to see our favourite songs as part of our life stories. Music both expresses and arouses emotions in a way that words alone cannot. In short, it is difficult to imagine life without it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my opinion, traditional music should be valued over the international music that has become so popular. International pop music is often catchy and fun, but it is essentially a commercial product that is marketed and sold by business people. Traditional music, by contrast, expresses the culture, customs and history of a country. Traditional styles, such as …(example)…, connect us to the past and form part of our cultural identity. It would be a real pity if pop music became so predominant that these national styles disappeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: 4.1.4</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.1.4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 21:01:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/l4.1.4/</guid><description>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll hear a talk on the subject of the urban landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, you have some time to look at questions thirty-one to forty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now listen carefully and answer questions thirty-one to forty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two major areas that I will focus on in my talk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How vegetation can have a significant effect on urban climate?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And how we can better plan our cities using trees to provide a more comfortable environment for us to live in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trees can have a significant impact on our cities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They can make a city, as a whole, a bit less windy or a bit more windy, if that&amp;rsquo;s what you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They can make it a bit cooler if it&amp;rsquo;s a hot summer day in an Australian city, or they can make it a bit more humid if it&amp;rsquo;s a dry inland city.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the local scale - that is, in particular areas within the city - trees can make the local area more shady, cooler, more humid and much less windy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact trees and planting of various kinds can be used to make city streets actually less dangerous in particular areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do trees do all that, you ask?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, the main difference between a tree and a building is a tree has got an internal mechanism to keep the temperature regulated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It evaporates water through its leaves and that means that the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own body temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The temperature of a building surface on a hot sunny day can easily be twenty degrees more than our temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trees, on the other hand, remain cooler than buildings because they sweat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that they can humidify the air and cool it- a property which can be exploited to improve the local climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trees can also help break the force of winds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason that high buildings make it windier at ground level is that, as the wind goes higher and higher, it goes faster and faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of it goes over the top and some goes around the sides of the building, forcing those high level winds down to ground level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen when you have trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trees filter the wind and considerably reduce it, preventing those very large strong gusts that you so often find around tall buildings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another problem in built-up areas is that traffic noise is intensified by tall buildings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By planting a belt of trees at the side of the road, you can make things a little quieter, but much of the vehicle noise still goes through the trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trees can also help reduce the amount of noise in the surroundings, although the effect is not as large as people like to think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Low-frequency noise, in particular, just goes through the trees as though they aren&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although trees can significantly improve the local climate, they do however take up a lot of space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are root systems to consider and branches blocking windows and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It may therefore be difficult to fit trees into the local landscape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is not a great deal you can do if you have what we call a street canyon - a whole set of high-rises enclosed in a narrow street.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trees need water to grow. They also need some sunlight to grow and you need room to put them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them, then suddenly you can start looking at different ways to design the streets and to introduce&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of section four, you now have half a minute to check your answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is the end of the listening test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the IELTS test, you would now have ten minutes to transfer your answers to the listening answer sheet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.4.1 The Impact of Wilderness Tourism</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.4.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 13:13:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.4.1/</guid><description>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The market for tourism in remote areas is booming as never before. Countries all across the world are actively promoting their ‘wilderness’ regions - such as mountains, Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands - to high-spending tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious: by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. But that does not mean that there is no cost. As the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development recognized, these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants. The three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and also in terms of the proportion of the Earth’s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains and Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently, most human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring. For several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona’s Monument Valley.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Once a location is established as a main tourist destination, the effects on the local community are profound. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these regions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season. However, as some inhabitants become involved in tourism, they no longer have time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores. Tourism is not always the culprit behind such changes. All kinds of wage labour, or government handouts, tend to undermine traditional survival systems. Whatever the cause, the dilemma is always the same: what happens if these new, external sources of income dry up?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The physical impact of visitors is another serious problem associated with the growth in adventure tourism. Much attention has focused on erosion along major trails, but perhaps more important are the deforestation and impacts on water supplies arising from the need to provide tourists with cooked food and hot showers. In both mountains and deserts, slow-growing trees are often the main sources of fuel and water supplies may be limited or vulnerable to degradation through heavy use.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Stories about the problems of tourism have become legion in the last few years. Yet it does not have to be a problem. Although tourism inevitably affects the region in which it takes place, the costs to these fragile environments and their local cultures can be minimized. Indeed, it can even be a vehicle for reinvigorating local cultures, as has happened with the Sherpas of Nepal’s Khumbu Valley and in some Alpine villages. And a growing number of adventure tourism operators are trying to ensure that their activities benefit the local population and environment over the long term.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on integrating tourism more effectively with the local economy. Local concern about the rising number of second home developments in the Swiss Pays d’Enhaut resulted in limits being imposed on their growth. There has also been a renaissance in communal cheese production in the area, providing the locals with a reliable source of income that does not depend on outside visitors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the Arctic tourist destinations have been exploited by outside companies, who employ transient workers and repatriate most of the profits to their home base. But some Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves, thereby ensuring that the benefits accrue locally. For instance, a native corporation in Alaska, employing local people, is running an air tour from Anchorage to Kotzebue, where tourists eat Arctic food, walk on the tundra and watch local musicians and dancers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Native people in the desert regions of the American Southwest have followed similar strategies, encouraging tourists to visit their pueblos and reservations to purchase high-quality handicrafts and artwork. The Acoma and San Ildefonso pueblos have established highly profitable pottery businesses, while the Navajo and Hopi groups have been similarly successful with jewellery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Too many people living in fragile environments have lost control over their economies, their culture and their environment when tourism has penetrated their homelands. Merely restricting tourism cannot be the solution to the imbalance, because people’s desire to see new places will not just disappear. Instead, communities in fragile environments must achieve greater control over tourism ventures in their regions, in order to balance their needs and aspirations with the demands of tourism. A growing number of communities are demonstrating that, with firm communal decision-making, this is possible. The critical question now is whether this can become the norm, rather than the exception.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.4.2 Flawed Beauty： the problem with toughened glass</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.4.2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 13:13:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.4.2/</guid><description>
&lt;p>On 2nd August 1999, a particularly hot day in the town of Cirencester in the UK, a large pane of toughened glass in the roof of a shopping centre at Bishops Walk shattered without warning and fell from its frame. When fragments were analysed by experts at the giant glass manufacturer Pilkington, which had made the pane, they found that minute crystals of nickel sulphide trapped inside the glass had almost certainly caused the failure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;The glass industry is aware of the issue,&amp;rsquo; says Brian Waldron, chairman of the standards committee at the Glass and Glazing Federation, a British trade association, and standards development officer at Pilkington. But he insists that cases are few and far between. &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a very rare phenomenon,&amp;rsquo; he says.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Others disagree. &amp;lsquo;On average I see about one or two buildings a month suffering from nickel sulphide related failures,&amp;rsquo; says Barrie Josie, a consultant engineer involved in the Bishops Walk investigation. Other experts tell of similar experiences. Tony Wilmott of London-based consulting engineers Sandberg, and Simon Armstrong at CladTech Associates in Hampshire both say they know of hundreds of cases. &amp;lsquo;What you hear is only the tip of the iceberg,&amp;rsquo; says Trevor Ford, a glass expert at Resolve Engineering in Brisbane, Queensland. He believes the reason is simple: &amp;lsquo;No-one wants bad press.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Toughened glass is found everywhere, from cars and bus shelters to the windows, walls and roofs of thousands of buildings around the world. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see why. This glass has five times the strength of standard glass, and when it does break it shatters into tiny cubes rather than large, razor-sharp shards. Architects love it because large panels can be bolted together to make transparent walls, and turning it into ceilings and floors is almost as easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is made by heating a sheet of ordinary glass to about 620℃ to soften it slightly, allowing its structure to expand, and then cooling it rapidly with jets of cold air. This causes the outer layer of the pane to contract and solidify before the interior. When the interior finally solidifies and shrinks, it exerts a pull on the outer layer that leaves it in permanent compression and produces a tensile force inside the glass. As cracks propagate best in materials under tension, the compressive force on the surface must be overcome before the pane will break, making it more resistant to cracking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem starts when glass contains nickel sulphide impurities. Trace amounts of nickel and sulphur are usually present in the raw materials used to make glass, and nickel can also be introduced by fragments of nickel alloys falling into the molten glass. As the glass is heated, these atoms react to form tiny crystals of nickel sulphide. Just a tenth of a gram of nickel in the furnace can create up to 50,000 crystals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These crystals can exist in two forms: a dense form called the alpha phase, which is stable at high temperatures, and a less dense form called the beta phase, which is stable at room temperatures. The high temperatures used in the toughening process convert all the crystals to the dense, compact alpha form. But the subsequent cooling is so rapid that the crystals don’t have time to change back to the beta phase. This leaves unstable alpha crystals in the glass, primed like a coiled spring, ready to revert to the beta phase without warning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When this happens, the crystals expand by up to 4%. And if they are within the central, tensile region of the pane, the stresses this unleashes can shatter the whole sheet. The time that elapses before failure occurs is unpredictable. It could happen just months after manufacture, or decades later, although if the glass is heated - by sunlight, for example - the process is speeded up. Ironically, says Graham Dodd, of consulting engineers Arup in London, the oldest pane of toughened glass known to have failed due to nickel sulphide inclusions was in Pilkington&amp;rsquo;s glass research building in Lathom, Lancashire. The pane was 27 years old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data showing the scale of the nickel sulphide problem is almost impossible to find. The picture is made more complicated by the fact that these crystals occur in batches. So even if, on average, there is only one inclusion in 7 tonnes of glass, if you experience one nickel sulphide failure in your building, that probably means you&amp;rsquo;ve got a problem in more than one pane. Josie says that in the last decade he has worked on over 15 buildings with the number of failures into double figures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the worst examples of this is Waterfront Place, which was completed in 1990. Over the following decade the 40-storey Brisbane block suffered a rash of failures. Eighty panes of its toughened glass shattered due to inclusions before experts were finally called in. John Barry, an expert in nickel sulphide contamination at the University of Queensland, analysed every glass pane in the building. Using a studio camera, a photographer went up in a cradle to take photos of every pane. These were scanned under a modified microfiche reader for signs of nickel sulphide crystals. &amp;lsquo;We discovered at least another 120 panes with potentially dangerous inclusions which were then replaced,&amp;rsquo; says Barry. &amp;lsquo;It was a very expensive and time-consuming process that took around six months to complete.&amp;rsquo; Though the project cost A$1.6 million (nearly ￡700,000), the alternative - re-cladding the entire building - would have cost ten times as much.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.4.3 The effects of light on plant and animal species</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.4.3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 13:13:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.4.3/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Light is important to organisms for two different reasons. Firstly it is used as a cue for the timing of daily and seasonal rhythms in both plants and animals, and secondly it is used to assist growth in plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breeding in most organisms occurs during a part of the year only, and so a reliable cue is needed to trigger breeding behaviour. Day length is an excellent cue, because it provides a perfectly predictable pattern of change within the year. In the temperate zone in spring, temperatures fluctuate greatly from day to day, but day length increases steadily by a predictable amount. The seasonal impact of day length on physiological responses is called photoperiodism, and the amount of experimental evidence for this phenomenon is considerable. For example, some species of birds&amp;rsquo; breeding can be induced even in midwinter simply by increasing day length artificially (Wolfson 1964). Other examples of photoperiodism occur in plants. A short-day plant flowers when the day is less than a certain critical length. A long-day plant flowers after a certain critical day length is exceeded. In both cases the critical day length differs from species to species. Plants which flower after a period of vegetative growth, regardless of photoperiod, are known as day-neutral plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Breeding seasons in animals such as birds have evolved to occupy the part of the year in which offspring have the greatest chances of survival. Before the breeding season begins, food reserves must be built up to support the energy cost of reproduction, and to provide for young birds both when they are in the nest and after fiedging. Thus many temperate-zone birds use the increasing day lengths in spring as a cue to begin the nesting cycle, because this is a point when adequate food resources will be assured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The adaptive significance of photoperiodism in plants is also clear. Short-day plants that flower in spring in the temperate zone are adapted to maximising seedling growth during the growing season. Long-day plants are adapted for situations that require fertilization by insects, or a long period of seed ripening. Short-day plants that flower in the autumn in the temperate zone are able to build up food reserves over the growing season and over winter as seeds. Day-neutral plants have an evolutionary advantage when the connection between the favourable period for reproduction and day length is much less certain. For example, desert annuals germinate, flower and seed whenever suitable rainfall occurs, regardless of the day length.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The breeding season of some plants can be delayed to extraordinary lengths. Bamboos are perennial grasses that remain in a vegetative state for many years and then suddenly flower, fruit and die (Evans 1976). Every bamboo of the species Chusquea abietifolia on the island of Jamaica flowered, set seed and died during 1884. The next generation of bamboo flowered and died between 1916 and 1918, which suggests a vegetative cycle of about 31 years. The climatic trigger for this flowering cycle is not yet known, but the adaptive significance is clear. The simultaneous production of masses of bamboo seeds (in some cases lying 12 to 15 centimetres deep on the ground) is more than all the seed-eating animals can cope with at the time, so that some seeds escape being eaten and grow up to form the next generation (Evans 1976).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second reason light is important to organisms is that it is essential for photosynthesis. This is the process by which plants use energy from the sun to convert carbon from soil or water into organic material for growth. The rate of photosynthesis in a plant can be measured by calculating the rate of its uptake of carbon. There is a wide range of photosynthetic responses of plants to variations in light intensity. Some plants reach maximal photosynthesis at one-quarter full sunlight, and others, like sugarcane, never reach a maximum, but continue to increase photosynthesis rate as light intensity rises.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plants in general can be divided into two groups: shade-tolerant species and shade-intolerant species. This classification is commonly used in forestry and horticulture. Shade-tolerant plants have lower photosynthetic rates and hence have lower growth rates than those of shade-intolerant species. Plant species become adapted to living in a certain kind of habitat, and in the process evolve a series of characteristics that prevent them from occupying other habitats. Grime (1966) suggests that light may be one of the major components directing these adaptations. For example, eastern hemlock seedlings are shade-tolerant. They can survive in the forest understorey under very low light levels because they have a low photosynthetic rate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.3.1 Early Childhood Education</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.3.1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 13:17:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.3.1/</guid><description>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>New Zealand’s National Party spokesman on education, Dr Lockwood Smith, recently visited the US and Britain. Here he reports on the findings of his trip and what they could mean for New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s education policy&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>‘Education To Be More’ was published last August. It was the report of the New Zealand Government&amp;rsquo;s Early Childhood Care and Education Working Group. The report argued for enhanced equity of access and better funding for childcare and early childhood education institutions. Unquestionably, that&amp;rsquo;s a real need; but since parents don&amp;rsquo;t normally send children to pre-schools until the age of three, are we missing out on the most important years of all?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A 13-year study of early childhood development at Harvard University has shown that, by the age of three, most children have the potential to understand about 1000 words - most of the language they will use in ordinary conversation for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, research has shown that while every child is born with a natural curiosity, it can be suppressed dramatically during the second and third years of life. Researchers claim that the human personality is formed during the first two years of life, and during the first three years children learn the basic skills they will use in all their later learning both at home and at school. Once over the age of three, children continue to expand on existing knowledge of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It is generally acknowledged that young people from poorer socio-economic backgrounds tend to do less well in our education system. That&amp;rsquo;s observed not just in New Zealand, but also in Australia, Britain and America. In an attempt to overcome that educational under-achievement, a nationwide programme called &amp;lsquo;Headstart&amp;rsquo; was launched in the United States in 1965. A lot of money was poured into it. It took children into pre-school institutions at the age of three and was supposed to help the children of poorer families succeed in school.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite substantial funding, results have been disappointing. It is thought that there are two explanations for this. First, the programme began too late. Many children who entered it at the age of three were already behind their peers in language and measurable intelligence. Second, the parents were not involved. At the end of each day, &amp;lsquo;Headstart&amp;rsquo; children returned to the same disadvantaged home environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As a result of the growing research evidence of the importance of the first three years of a child&amp;rsquo;s life and the disappointing results from &amp;lsquo;Headstart&amp;rsquo;, a pilot programme was launched in Missouri in the US that focused on parents as the child&amp;rsquo;s first teachers. The &amp;lsquo;Missouri&amp;rsquo; programme was predicated on research showing that working with the family, rather than bypassing the parents, is the most effective way of helping children get off to the best possible start in life. The four-year pilot study included 380 families who were about to have their first child and who represented a cross-section of socio-economic status, age and family configurations. They included single-parent and two-parent families, families in which both parents worked, and families with either the mother or father at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The programme involved trained parent-educators visiting the parents&amp;rsquo; home and working with the parent, or parents, and the child. Information on child development, and guidance on things to look for and expect as the child grows were provided, plus guidance in fostering the child&amp;rsquo;s intellectual, language, social and motor-skill development. Periodic check-ups of the child&amp;rsquo;s educational and sensory development (hearing and vision) were made to detect possible handicaps that interfere with growth and development. Medical problems were referred to professionals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Parent-educators made personal visits to homes and monthly group meetings were held with other new parents to share experience and discuss topics of interest. Parent resource centres, located in school buildings, offered learning materials for families and facilitators for child care.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At the age of three, the children who had been involved in the &amp;lsquo;Missouri&amp;rsquo; programme were evaluated alongside a cross-section of children selected from the same range of socio-economic backgrounds and family situations, and also a random sample of children that age. The results were phenomenal. By the age of three, the children in the programme were significantly more advanced in language development than their peers, had made greater strides in problem solving and other intellectual skills, and were further along in social development. In fact, the average child on the programme was performing at the level of the top 15 to 20 per cent of their peers in such things as auditory comprehension, verbal ability and language ability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most important of all, the traditional measures of &amp;lsquo;risk&amp;rsquo;, such as parents&amp;rsquo; age and education, or whether they were a single parent, bore little or no relationship to the measures of achievement and language development. Children in the programme performed equally well regardless of socio-economic disadvantages. Child abuse was virtually eliminated. The one factor that was found to affect the child s development was family stress leading to a poor quality of parent-child interaction. That interaction was not necessarily bad in poorer families.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>These research findings are exciting. There is growing evidence in New Zealand that children from poorer socio-economic backgrounds are arriving at school less well developed and that our school system tends to perpetuate that disadvantage. The initiative outlined above could break that cycle of disadvantage. The concept of working with parents in their homes, or at their place of work, contrasts quite markedly with the report of the Early Childhood Care and Education Working Group. Their focus is on getting children and mothers access to childcare and institutionalised early childhood education. Education from the age of three to five is undoubtedly vital, but without a similar focus on parent education and on the vital importance of the first three years, some evidence indicates that it will not be enough to overcome educational inequity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.3.2 Disappearing Delta</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.3.2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 13:17:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.3.2/</guid><description>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The fertile land of the Nile delta is being eroded along Egypt’s Mediterranean coast at an astounding rate, in some parts estimated at 100 metres per year. In the past, land scoured away from the coastline by the currents of the Mediterranean Sea used to be replaced by sediment brought down to the delta by the River Nile, but this is no longer happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Up to now, people have blamed this loss of delta land on the two large dams at Aswan in the south of Egypt, which hold back virtually all of the sediment that used to flow down the river. Before the dams were built, the Nile flowed freely, carrying huge quantities of sediment north from Africa’s interior to be deposited on the Nile delta. This continued for 7,000 years, eventually covering a region of over 22,000 square kilometres with layers of fertile silt . Annual flooding brought in new, nutrient-rich soil to the delta region, replacing what had been washed away by the sea, and dispensing with the need for fertilizers in Egypt’s richest food-growing area. But when the Aswan dams were constructed in the 20th century to provide electricity and irrigation, and to protect the huge population centre of Cairo and its surrounding areas from annual flooding and drought, most of the sediment with its natural fertilizer accumulated up above the dam in the southern, upstream half of Lake Nasser, instead of passing down to the delta.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Now, however, there turns out to be more to the story. It appears that the sediment-free water emerging from the Aswan dams picks up silt and sand as it erodes the river bed and banks on the 800-kilometre trip to Cairo. Daniel Jean Stanley of the Smithsonian Institute noticed that water samples taken in Cairo, just before the river enters the delta, indicated that the river sometimes carries more than 850 grams of sediment per cubic metre of water - almost half of what it carried before the dams were built. ‘I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed to say that the significance of this didn’t strike me until after I had read 50 or 60 studies,’ says Stanley in Marine Geology. ‘There is still a lot of sediment coming into the delta, but virtually no sediment comes out into the Mediterranean to replenish the coastline. So this sediment must be trapped on the delta itself.’&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Once north of Cairo, most of the Nile water is diverted into more than 10,000 kilometres of irrigation canals and only a small proportion reaches the sea directly through the rivers in the delta. The water in the irrigation canals is still or very slow-moving and thus cannot carry sediment, Stanley explains. The sediment sinks to the bottom of the canals and then is added to fields by farmers or pumped with the water into the four large freshwater lagoons that are located near the outer edges of the delta. So very little of it actually reaches the coastline to replace what is being washed away by the Mediterranean currents.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The farms on the delta plains and fishing and aquaculture in the lagoons account for much of Egypt’s food supply. But by the time the sediment has come to rest in the fields and lagoons it is laden with municipal, industrial and agricultural waste from the Cairo region, which is home to more than 40 million people. ‘Pollutants are building up faster and faster,’ says Stanley.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on his investigations of sediment from the delta lagoons, Frederic Siegel of George Washington University concurs. ‘In Manzalah Lagoon, for example, the increase in mercury, lead, copper and zinc coincided with the building of the High Dam at Aswan, the availability of cheap electricity, and the development of major power-based industries,’ he says. Since that time the concentration of mercury has increased significantly. Lead from engines that use leaded fuels and from other industrial sources has also increased dramatically. These poisons can easily enter the food chain, affecting the productivity of fishing and farming. Another problem is that agricultural wastes include fertilizers which stimulate increases in plant growth in the lagoons and upset the ecology of the area, with serious effects on the fishing industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>According to Siegel, international environmental organisations are beginning to pay closer attention to the region, partly because of the problems of erosion and pollution of the Nile delta, but principally because they fear the impact this situation could have on the whole Mediterranean coastal ecosystem. But there are no easy solutions. In the immediate future, Stanley believes that one solution would be to make artificial floods to flush out the delta waterways, in the same way that natural floods did before the construction of the dams. He says, however, that in the long term an alternative process such as desalination may have to be used to increase the amount of water available. ‘In my view, Egypt must devise a way to have more water running through the river and the delta,’ says Stanley. Easier said than done in a desert region with a rapidly growing population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.3.3 The Return of Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.3.3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 13:17:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.3.3/</guid><description>

&lt;p>It is becoming acceptable again to talk of computers performing human tasks such as problem-solving and pattern-recognition&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>After years in the wilderness, the term &amp;lsquo;artificial intelligence&amp;rsquo; (AI) seems poised to make a comeback. AI was big in the 1980s but vanished in the 1990s. It re-entered public consciousness with the release of AI, a movie about a robot boy. This has ignited public debate about AI, but the term is also being used once more within the computer industry. Researchers, executives and marketing people are now using the expression without irony or inverted commas. And it is not always hype. The term is being applied, with some justification, to products that depend on technology that was originally developed by AI researchers. Admittedly, the rehabilitation of the term has a long way to go, and some firms still prefer to avoid using it. But the fact that others are starting to use it again suggests that AI has moved on from being seen as an over-ambitious and under-achieving field of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The field was launched, and the term ‘artificial intelligence’ coined, at a conference in 1956 by a group of researchers that included Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, all of whom went on to become leading figures in the field. The expression provided an attractive but informative name for a research programme that encompassed such previously disparate fields as operations research, cybernetics, logic and computer science. The goal they shared was an attempt to capture or mimic human abilities using machines. That said, different groups of researchers attacked different problems, from speech recognition to chess playing, in different ways; AI unified the field in name only. But it was a term that captured the public imagination.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Most researchers agree that AI peaked around 1985. A public reared on science-fiction movies and excited by the growing power of computers had high expectations. For years, AI researchers had implied that a breakthrough was just around the corner. Marvin Minsky said in 1967 that within a generation the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ would be substantially solved. Prototypes of medical-diagnosis programs and speech recognition software appeared to be making progress. It proved to be a false dawn. Thinking computers and household robots failed to materialise, and a backlash ensued. ‘There was undue optimism in the early 1980s,’ says David Leake, a researcher at Indiana University. ‘Then when people realised these were hard problems, there was retrenchment. By the late 1980s, the term AI was being avoided by many researchers, who opted instead to align themselves with specific sub-disciplines such as neural networks, agent technology, case-based reasoning, and so on.’&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Ironically, in some ways AI was a victim of its own success. Whenever an apparently mundane problem was solved, such as building a system that could land an aircraft unattended, the problem was deemed not to have been AI in the first place. ‘If it works, it can’t be AI,’ as Dr Leake characterises it. The effect of repeatedly moving the goal-posts in this way was that AI came to refer to ‘blue-sky’ research that was still years away from commercialisation. Researchers joked that AI stood for ‘almost implemented’. Meanwhile, the technologies that made it onto the market, such as speech recognition, language translation and decision-support software, were no longer regarded as AI. Yet all three once fell well within the umbrella of AI research.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>But the tide may now be turning, according to Dr Leake. HNC Software of San Diego, backed by a government agency, reckon that their new approach to artificial intelligence is the most powerful and promising approach ever discovered. HNC claim that their system, based on a cluster of 30 processors, could be used to spot camouflaged vehicles on a battlefield or extract a voice signal from a noisy background - tasks humans can do well, but computers cannot. ‘Whether or not their technology lives up to the claims made for it, the fact that HNC are emphasising the use of AI is itself an interesting development,’ says Dr Leake.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Another factor that may boost the prospects for AI in the near future is that investors are now looking for firms using clever technology, rather than just a clever business model, to differentiate themselves. In particular, the problem of information overload, exacerbated by the growth of e-mail and the explosion in the number of web pages, means there are plenty of opportunities for new technologies to help filter and categorise information - classic AI problems. That may mean that more artificial intelligence companies will start to emerge to meet this challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="g">G&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The 1969 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, featured an intelligent computer called HAL 9000. As well as understanding and speaking English, HAL could play chess and even learned to lipread. HAL thus encapsulated the optimism of the 1960s that intelligent computers would be widespread by 2001. But 2001 has been and gone, and there is still no sign of a HAL-like computer. Individual systems can play chess or transcribe speech, but a general theory of machine intelligence still remains elusive. It may be, however, that the comparison with HAL no longer seems quite so important, and AI can now be judged by what it can do, rather than by how well it matches up to a 30-year-old science-fiction film. ‘People are beginning to realise that there are impressive things that these systems can do,’ says Dr Leake hopefully.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.2.1 BAKELITE</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.2.1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 19:17:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.2.1/</guid><description>
&lt;h4 id="the-birth-of-modern-plastics">The birth of modern plastics&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In 1907, Leo Hendrick Baekeland, a Belgian scientist working in New York, discovered and patented a revolutionary new synthetic material. His invention, which he named &amp;lsquo;Bakelite&amp;rsquo;, was of enormous technological importance, and effectively launched the modern plastics industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The term &amp;lsquo;plastic&amp;rsquo; comes from the Greek plassein, meaning &amp;rsquo;to mould&amp;rsquo;. Some plastics are derived from natural sources, some are semi-synthetic (the result of chemical action on a natural substance), and some are entirely synthetic, that is, chemically engineered from the constituents of coal or oil. Some are &amp;rsquo;thermoplastic&amp;rsquo;, which means that, like candlewax, they melt when heated and can then be reshaped. Others are &amp;rsquo;thermosetting&amp;rsquo;: like eggs, they cannot revert to their original viscous state, and their shape is thus fixed for ever. Bakelite had the distinction of being the first totally synthetic thermosetting plastic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The history of today&amp;rsquo;s plastics begins with the discovery of a series of semi-synthetic thermoplastic materials in the mid-nineteenth century. The impetus behind the development of these early plastics was generated by a number of factors - immense technological progress in the domain of chemistry, coupled with wider cultural changes, and the pragmatic need to find acceptable substitutes for dwindling supplies of &amp;rsquo;luxury&amp;rsquo; materials such as tortoiseshell and ivory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Baekeland&amp;rsquo;s interest in plastics began in 1885 when, as a young chemistry student in Belgium, he embarked on research into phenolic resins, the group of sticky substances produced when phenol (carbolic acid) combines with an aldehyde (a volatile fluid similar to alcohol). He soon abandoned the subject, however, only returning to it some years later. By 1905 he was a wealthy New Yorker, having recently made his fortune with the invention of a new photographic paper. While Baekeland had been busily amassing dollars, some advances had been made in the development of plastics. The years 1899 and 1900 had seen the patenting of the first semi-synthetic thermosetting material that could be manufactured on an industrial scale. In purely scientific terms, Baekeland&amp;rsquo;s major contribution to the field is not so much the actual discovery of the material to which he gave his name, but rather the method by which a reaction between phenol and formaldehyde could be controlled, thus making possible its preparation on a commercial basis. On 13 July 1907, Baekeland took out his famous patent describing this preparation, the essential features of which are still in use today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original patent outlined a three-stage process, in which phenol and formaldehyde (from wood or coal) were initially combined under vacuum inside a large egg-shaped kettle. The result was a resin known as Novalak, which became soluble and malleable when heated. The resin was allowed to cool in shallow trays until it hardened, and then broken up and ground into powder. Other substances were then introduced: including fillers, such as woodflour, asbestos or cotton, which increase strength and moisture resistance, catalysts (substances to speed up the reaction between two chemicals without joining to either) and hexa, a compound of ammonia and formaldehyde which supplied the additional formaldehyde necessary to form a thermosetting resin. This resin was then left to cool and harden, and ground up a second time. The resulting granular powder was raw Bakelite, ready to be made into a vast range of manufactured objects. In the last stage, the heated Bakelite was poured into a hollow mould of the required shape and subjected to extreme heat and pressure, thereby &amp;lsquo;setting&amp;rsquo; its form for life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The design of Bakelite objects, everything from earrings to television sets, was governed to a large extent by the technical requirements of the moulding process. The object could not be designed so that it was locked into the mould and therefore difficult to extract. A common general rule was that objects should taper towards the deepest part of the mould, and if necessary the product was moulded in separate pieces. Moulds had to be carefully designed so that the molten Bakelite would flow evenly and completely into the mould. Sharp corners proved impractical and were thus avoided, giving rise to the smooth, &amp;lsquo;streamlined&amp;rsquo; style popular in the 1930s. The thickness of the walls of the mould was also crucial: thick walls took longer to cool and harden, a factor which had to be considered by the designer in order to make the most efficient use of machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Baekeland&amp;rsquo;s invention, although treated with disdain in its early years, went on to enjoy an unparalleled popularity which lasted throughout the first half of the twentieth century. It became the wonder product of the new world of industrial expansion - &amp;rsquo;the material of a thousand uses&amp;rsquo;. Being both non-porous and heat-resistant, Bakelite kitchen goods were promoted as being germ-free and sterilisable. Electrical manufacturers seized on its insulating properties, and consumers everywhere relished its dazzling array of shades, delighted that they were now, at last, no longer restricted to the wood tones and drab browns of the pre-plastic era. It then fell from favour again during the 1950s, and was despised and destroyed in vast quantities. Recently, however, it has been experiencing something of a renaissance, with renewed demand for original Bakelite objects in the collectors&amp;rsquo; marketplace, and museums, societies and dedicated individuals once again appreciating the style and originality of this innovative material.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.2.2 What’s so funny?</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.2.2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 19:17:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.2.2/</guid><description>

&lt;p>John McCrone reviews recent research on humour&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The joke comes over the headphones: &amp;lsquo;Which side of a dog has the most hair? The left.&amp;rsquo; No, not funny. Try again. &amp;lsquo;Which side of a dog has the most hair? The outside.&amp;rsquo; Hah! The punchline is silly yet fitting, tempting a smile, even a laugh. Laughter has always struck people as deeply mysterious, perhaps pointless. The writer Arthur Koestler dubbed it the luxury reflex: &amp;lsquo;unique in that it serves no apparent biological purpose&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Theories about humour have an ancient pedigree. Plato expressed the idea that humour is simply a delighted feeling of superiority over others. Kant and Freud felt that joke-telling relies on building up a psychic tension which is safely punctured by the ludicrousness of the punchline. But most modern humour theorists have settled on some version of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s belief that jokes are based on a reaction to or resolution of incongruity, when the punchline is either a nonsense or, though appearing silly, has a clever second meaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Graeme Ritchie, a computational linguist in Edinburgh, studies the linguistic structure of jokes in order to understand not only humour but language understanding and reasoning in machines. He says that while there is no single format for jokes, many revolve around a sudden and surprising conceptual shift. A comedian will present a situation followed by an unexpected interpretation that is also apt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So even if a punchline sounds silly, the listener can see there is a clever semantic fit and that sudden mental &amp;lsquo;Aha!&amp;rsquo; is the buzz that makes us laugh. Viewed from this angle, humour is just a form of creative insight, a sudden leap to a new perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is another type of laughter, the laughter of social appeasement and it is important to understand this too. Play is a crucial part of development in most young mammals. Rats produce ultrasonic squeaks to prevent their scuffles turning nasty. Chimpanzees have a &amp;lsquo;play-face&amp;rsquo; - a gaping expression accompanied by a panting &amp;lsquo;ah, ah&amp;rsquo; noise. In humans, these signals have mutated into smiles and laughs. Researchers believe social situations, rather than cognitive events such as jokes, trigger these instinctual markers of play or appeasement. People laugh on fairground rides or when tickled to flag a play situation, whether they feel amused or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both social and cognitive types of laughter tap into the same expressive machinery in our brains, the emotion and motor circuits that produce smiles and excited vocalisations. However, if cognitive laughter is the product of more general thought processes, it should result from more expansive brain activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Psychologist Vinod Goel investigated humour using the new technique of &amp;lsquo;single event&amp;rsquo; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An MRI scanner uses magnetic fields and radio waves to track the changes in oxygenated blood that accompany mental activity. Until recently, MRI scanners needed several minutes of activity and so could not be used to track rapid thought processes such as comprehending a joke. New developments now allow half-second &amp;lsquo;snapshots&amp;rsquo; of all sorts of reasoning and problem-solving activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although Goel felt being inside a brain scanner was hardly the ideal place for appreciating a joke, he found evidence that understanding a joke involves a widespread mental shift. His scans showed that at the beginning of a joke the listener&amp;rsquo;s prefrontal cortex lit up, particularly the right prefrontal believed to be critical for problem solving. But there was also activity in the temporal lobes at the side of the head (consistent with attempts to rouse stored knowledge) and in many other brain areas. Then when the punchline arrived, a new area sprang to life - the orbital prefrontal cortex. This patch of brain tucked behind the orbits of the eyes is associated with evaluating information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making a rapid emotional assessment of the events of the moment is an extremely demanding job for the brain, animal or human. Energy and arousal levels may need to be retuned in the blink of an eye. These abrupt changes will produce either positive or negative feelings. The orbital cortex, the region that becomes active in Goel&amp;rsquo;s experiment, seems the best candidate for the site that feeds such feelings into higher-level thought processes, with its close connections to the brain&amp;rsquo;s sub-cortical arousal apparatus and centres of metabolic control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All warm-blooded animals make constant tiny adjustments in arousal in response to external events, but humans, who have developed a much more complicated internal life as a result of language, respond emotionally not only to their surroundings, but to their own thoughts. Whenever a sought-for answer snaps into place, there is a shudder of pleased recognition. Creative discovery being pleasurable, humans have learned to find ways of milking this natural response. The fact that jokes tap into our general evaluative machinery explains why the line between funny and disgusting, or funny and frightening, can be so fine. Whether a joke gives pleasure or pain depends on a person&amp;rsquo;s outlook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Humour may be a luxury, but the mechanism behind it is no evolutionary accident. As Peter Derks, a psychologist at William and Mary College in Virginia, says: &amp;lsquo;I like to think of humour as the distorted mirror of the mind. It&amp;rsquo;s creative, perceptual, analytical and lingual. If we can figure out how the mind processes humour, then we&amp;rsquo;ll have a pretty good handle on how it works in general.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.2.3 The Birth of Scientific English</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.2.3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 19:17:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.2.3/</guid><description>
&lt;p>World science is dominated today by a small number of languages, including Japanese, German and French, but it is English which is probably the most popular global language of science. This is not just because of the importance of English-speaking countries such as the USA in scientific research; the scientists of many non-English-speaking countries find that they need to write their research papers in English to reach a wide international audience. Given the prominence of scientific English today, it may seem surprising that no one really knew how to write science in English before the 17th century. Before that, Latin was regarded as the lingua franca1 for European intellectuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The European Renaissance (c. 14th-16th century) is sometimes called the &amp;lsquo;revival of learning&amp;rsquo;, a time of renewed interest in the &amp;rsquo;lost knowledge&amp;rsquo; of classical times. At the same time, however, scholars also began to test and extend this knowledge. The emergent nation states of Europe developed competitive interests in world exploration and the development of trade. Such expansion, which was to take the English language west to America and east to India, was supported by scientific developments such as the discovery of magnetism (and hence the invention of the compass), improvements in cartography and - perhaps the most important scientific revolution of them all - the new theories of astronomy and the movement of the Earth in relation to the planets and stars, developed by Copernicus (1473-1543).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>England was one of the first countries where scientists adopted and publicised Copernican ideas with enthusiasm. Some of these scholars, including two with interests in language -John Wallis and John Wilkins - helped found the Royal Society in 1660 in order to promote empirical scientific research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Across Europe similar academies and societies arose, creating new national traditions of science. In the initial stages of the scientific revolution, most publications in the national languages were popular works, encyclopaedias, educational textbooks and translations. Original science was not done in English until the second half of the 17th century. For example, Newton published his mathematical treatise, known as the Principia, in Latin, but published his later work on the properties of light - Opticks - in English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were several reasons why original science continued to be written in Latin. The first was simply a matter of audience. Latin was suitable for an international audience of scholars, whereas English reached a socially wider, but more local, audience. Hence, popular science was written in English.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A second reason for writing in Latin may, perversely, have been a concern for secrecy. Open publication had dangers in putting into the public domain preliminary ideas which had not yet been fully exploited by their &amp;lsquo;author&amp;rsquo;. This growing concern about intellectual property rights was a feature of the period - it reflected both the humanist notion of the individual, rational scientist who invents and discovers through private intellectual labour, and the growing connection between original science and commercial exploitation. There was something of a social distinction between &amp;lsquo;scholars and gentlemen&amp;rsquo; who understood Latin, and men of trade who lacked a classical education. And in the mid-17th century it was common practice for mathematicians to keep their discoveries and proofs secret, by writing them in cipher, in obscure languages, or in private messages deposited in a sealed box with the Royal Society. Some scientists might have felt more comfortable with Latin precisely because its audience, though international, was socially restricted. Doctors clung the most keenly to Latin as an &amp;lsquo;insider language&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A third reason why the writing of original science in English was delayed may have been to do with the linguistic inadequacy of English in the early modern period. English was not well equipped to deal with scientific argument. First, it lacked the necessary technical vocabulary. Second, it lacked the grammatical resources required to represent the world in an objective and impersonal way, and to discuss the relations, such as cause and effect, that might hold between complex and hypothetical entities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, several members of the Royal Society possessed an interest in language and became engaged in various linguistic projects. Although a proposal in 1664 to establish a committee for improving the English language came to little, the society&amp;rsquo;s members did a great deal to foster the publication of science in English and to encourage the development of a suitable writing style. Many members of the Royal Society also published monographs in English. One of the first was by Robert Hooke, the society&amp;rsquo;s first curator of experiments, who described his experiments with microscopes in Micrographia (1665). This work is largely narrative in style, based on a transcript of oral demonstrations and lectures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1665 a new scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions, was inaugurated. Perhaps the first international English-language scientific journal, it encouraged a new genre of scientific writing, that of short, focused accounts of particular experiments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 17th century was thus a formative period in the establishment of scientific English. In the following century much of this momentum was lost as German established itself as the leading European language of science. It is estimated that by the end of the 18th century 401 German scientific journals had been established as opposed to 96 in France and 50 in England. However, in the 19th century scientific English again enjoyed substantial lexical growth as the industrial revolution created the need for new technical vocabulary, and new, specialised, professional societies were instituted to promote and publish in the new disciplines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the century before Johnson&amp;rsquo;s Dictionary was published in 1775, there had been concern about the state of the English language. There was no standard way of speaking or writing and no agreement as to the best way of bringing some order to the chaos of English spelling. Dr Johnson provided the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There had, of course, been dictionaries in the past, the first of these being a little book of some 120 pages, compiled by a certain Robert Cawdray, published in 1604 under the title A Table Alphabeticall &amp;lsquo;of hard usuall English wordes&amp;rsquo;. Like the various dictionaries that came after it during the seventeenth century, Cawdray&amp;rsquo;s tended to concentrate on &amp;lsquo;scholarly&amp;rsquo; words; one function of the dictionary was to enable its student to convey an impression of fine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the practical need to make order out of chaos, the rise of dictionaries is associated with the rise of the English middle class, who were anxious to define and circumscribe the various worlds to conquer- lexical as well as social and commercial. It is highly appropriate that Dr Samuel Johnson, the very model of an eighteenth-century literary man, as famous in his own time as in ours, should have published his Dictionary at the very beginning of the heyday of the middle class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Johnson was a poet and critic who raised common sense to the heights of genius. His approach to the problems that had worried writers throughout the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries was intensely practical. Up until his time, the task of producing a dictionary on such a large scale had seemed impossible without the establishment of an academy to make decisions about right and wrong usage. Johnson decided he did not need an academy to settle arguments about language; he would write a dictionary himself; and he would do it single-handed. Johnson signed the contract for the Dictionary with the bookseller Robert Dosley at a breakfast held at the Golden Anchor Inn near Holborn Bar on 18 June 1764. He was to be paid ￡1,575 in instalments, and from this he took money to rent 17 Gough Square, in which he set up his &amp;lsquo;dictionary workshop&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>James Boswell, his biographer, described the garret where Johnson worked as &amp;lsquo;itted up like a counting house&amp;rsquo; with a long desk running down the middle at which the copying clerks would work standing up. Johnson himself was stationed on a rickety chair at an &amp;lsquo;old crazy deal table&amp;rsquo; surrounded by a chaos of borrowed books. He was also helped by six assistants, two of whom died whilst the Dictionary was still in preparation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The work was immense; filling about eighty large notebooks (and without a library to hand), Johnson wrote the definitions of over 40,000 words, and illustrated their many meanings with some 114,000 quotations drawn from English writing on every subject, from the Elizabethans to his own time. He did not expect to achieve complete originality. Working to a deadline, he had to draw on the best of all previous dictionaries, and to make his work one of heroic synthesis. In fact, it was very much more. Unlike his predecessors, Johnson treated English very practically, as a living language, with many different shades of meaning. He adopted his definitions on the principle of English common law-according to precedent. After its publication, his Dictionary was not seriously rivalled for over a century.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After many vicissitudes the Dictionary was finally published on 15 April 1775. It was instantly recognised as a landmark throughout Europe. &amp;lsquo;This very noble work,&amp;rsquo; wrote the leading Italian lexicographer, &amp;lsquo;will be a perpetual monument of Fame to the Author, an Honour to his own Country in particular, and a general Benefit to the republic of Letters throughout Europe.&amp;rsquo; The fact that Johnson had taken on the Academies of Europe and matched them (everyone knew that forty French academics had taken forty years to produce the first French national dictionary) was cause for much English celebration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Johnson had worked for nine years, &amp;lsquo;with little assistance of the learned, and without any patronage of the great; not in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of academic bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow&amp;rsquo;. For all its faults and eccentricities his two-volume work is a masterpiece and a landmark in his own words, &amp;lsquo;setting the orthography, displaying the analogy, regulating the structures, and ascertaining the significations of English words&amp;rsquo;. It is the cornerstone of Standard English, an achievement which, in James Boswell&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;lsquo;conferred stability on the language of his country&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Dictionary, together with his other writing, made Johnson famous and so well esteemed that his friends were able to prevail upon King George Ⅲ to offer him a pension. From then on, he was to become the Johnson of folklore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.1.2 Nature or Nurture?</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.1.2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 13:17:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.1.2/</guid><description>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A few years ago, in one of the most fascinating and disturbing experiments in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects from all walks of life for their willingness to obey instructions given by a &amp;rsquo;leader&amp;rsquo; in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal distaste for the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer &amp;rsquo;teacher-subject&amp;rsquo; that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils&amp;rsquo; ability to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Milgram&amp;rsquo;s experimental set-up involved placing the teacher-subject before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from &amp;lsquo;15 volts of electricity (slight shock)&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;450 volts (danger - severe shock)&amp;rsquo; in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered, beginning at the lowest level and increasing in severity with each successive wrong answer. The supposed &amp;lsquo;pupil&amp;rsquo; was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to simulate receiving the shocks by emitting a spectrum of groans, screams and writhings together with an assortment of statements and expletives denouncing both the experiment and the experimenter. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for, as per the rule governing the experimental situation of the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As the experiment unfolded, the pupil would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions posed by the teacher, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects balked at administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram with questioning looks and/or complaints about continuing the experiment. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to ignore the pupil&amp;rsquo;s cries for mercy and carry on with the experiment. If the subject was still reluctant to proceed, Milgram said that it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. His final argument was, &amp;lsquo;You have no other choice. You must go on.&amp;rsquo; What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion against the rules and conditions of the experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Prior to carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people in an ordinary population who would be willing to administer the highest shock level of 450 volts. The overwhelming consensus was that virtually all the teacher-subjects would refuse to obey the experimenter. The psychiatrists felt that &amp;lsquo;most subjects would not go beyond 150 volts&amp;rsquo; and they further anticipated that only four per cent would go up to 300 volts. Furthermore, they thought that only a lunatic fringe of about one in 1,000 would give the highest shock of 450 volts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What were the actual results? Well, over 60 per cent of the teacher-subjects continued to obey Milgram up to the 450-volt limit! In repetitions of the experiment in other countries, the percentage of obedient teacher-subjects was even higher, reaching 85 per cent in one country. How can we possibly account for this vast discrepancy between what calm, rational, knowledgeable people predict in the comfort of their study and what pressured, flustered, but cooperative &amp;rsquo;teachers&amp;rsquo; actually do in the laboratory of real life?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>One&amp;rsquo;s first inclination might be to argue that there must be some sort of built-in animal aggression instinct that was activated by the experiment, and that Milgram&amp;rsquo;s teacher-subjects were just following a genetic need to discharge this pent-up primal urge onto the pupil by administering the electrical shock. A modern hard-core sociobiologist might even go so far as to claim that this aggressive instinct evolved as an advantageous trait, having been of survival value to our ancestors in their struggle against the hardships of life on the plains and in the caves, ultimately finding its way into our genetic make-up as a remnant of our ancient animal ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="g">G&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>An alternative to this notion of genetic programming is to see the teacher-subjects&amp;rsquo; actions as a result of the social environment under which the experiment was carried out. As Milgram himself pointed out, &amp;lsquo;Most subjects in the experiment see their behaviour in a larger context that is benevolent and useful to society - the pursuit of scientific truth. The psychological laboratory has a strong claim to legitimacy and evokes trust and confidence in those who perform there. An action such as shocking a victim, which in isolation appears evil, acquires a completely different meaning when placed in this setting.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="h">H&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Thus, in this explanation the subject merges his unique personality and personal and moral code with that of larger institutional structures, surrendering individual properties like loyalty, self-sacrifice and discipline to the service of malevolent systems of authority.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="i">I&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Here we have two radically different explanations for why so many teacher-subjects were willing to forgo their sense of personal responsibility for the sake of an institutional authority figure. The problem for biologists, psychologists and anthropologists is to sort out which of these two polar explanations is more plausible. This, in essence, is the problem of modern sociobiology - to discover the degree to which hard-wired genetic programming dictates, or at least strongly biases, the interaction of animals and humans with their environment, that is, their behaviour. Put another way, sociobiology is concerned with elucidating the biological basis of all behaviour.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R5.1.3 The Truth about the Environment</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.1.3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 13:17:12 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r5.1.3/</guid><description>
&lt;p>For many environmentalists, the world seems to be getting worse. They have developed a hit-list of our main fears: that natural resources are running out; that the population is ever growing, leaving less and less to eat; that species are becoming extinct in vast numbers, and that the planet&amp;rsquo;s air and water are becoming ever more polluted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a quick look at the facts shows a different picture. First, energy and other natural resources have become more abundant, not less so, since the book &amp;lsquo;The Limits to Growth&amp;rsquo; was published in 1972 by a group of scientists. Second, more food is now produced per head of the world&amp;rsquo;s population than at any time in history. Fewer people are starving. Third, although species are indeed becoming extinct, only about 0.7% of them are expected to disappear in the next 50 years, not 25-50%, as has so often been predicted. And finally, most forms of environmental pollution either appear to have been exaggerated, or are transient - associated with the early phases of industrialisation and therefore best cured not by restricting economic growth, but by accelerating it. One form of pollution - the release of greenhouse gases that causes global warming - does appear to be a phenomenon that is going to extend well into our future, but its total impact is unlikely to pose a devastating problem. A bigger problem may well turn out to be an inappropriate response to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet opinion polls suggest that many people nurture the belief that environmental standards are declining and four factors seem to cause this disjunction between perception and reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One is the lopsidedness built into scientific research. Scientific funding goes mainly to areas with many problems. That may be wise policy, but it will also create an impression that many more potential problems exist than is the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, environmental groups need to be noticed by the mass media. They also need to keep the money rolling in. Understandably, perhaps, they sometimes overstate their arguments. In 1997, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature issued a press release entitled: &amp;lsquo;Two thirds of the world&amp;rsquo;s forests lost forever&amp;rsquo;. The truth turns out to be nearer 20%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though these groups are run overwhelmingly by selfless folk, they nevertheless share many of the characteristics of other lobby groups. That would matter less if people applied the same degree of scepticism to environmental lobbying as they do to lobby groups in other fields. A trade organisation arguing for, say, weaker pollution controls is instantly seen as self-interested. Yet a green organisation opposing such a weakening is seen as altruistic, even if an impartial view of the controls in question might suggest they are doing more harm than good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A third source of confusion is the attitude of the media. People are clearly more curious about bad news than good. Newspapers and broadcasters are there to provide what the public wants. That, however, can lead to significant distortions of perception. An example was America&amp;rsquo;s encounter with El Niño in 1997 and 1998. This climatic phenomenon was accused of wrecking tourism, causing allergies, melting the ski-slopes and causing 22 deaths. However, according to an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, the damage it did was estimated at US $4 billion but the benefits amounted to some US $19 billion. These came from higher winter temperatures (which saved an estimated 850 lives, reduced heating costs and diminished spring floods caused by meltwaters).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fourth factor is poor individual perception. People worry that the endless rise in the amount of stuff everyone throws away will cause the world to run out of places to dispose of waste. Yet, even if America&amp;rsquo;s trash output continues to rise as it has done in the past, and even if the American population doubles by 2100, all the rubbish America produces through the entire 21st century will still take up only one-12,000th of the area of the entire United States.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what of global warming? As we know, carbon dioxide emissions are causing the planet to warm. The best estimates are that the temperatures will rise by 2-3℃ in this century, causing considerable problems, at a total cost of US $5,000 billion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite the intuition that something drastic needs to be done about such a costly problem, economic analyses clearly show it will be far more expensive to cut carbon dioxide emissions radically than to pay the costs of adaptation to the increased temperatures. A model by one of the main authors of the United Nations Climate Change Panel shows how an expected temperature increase of 2.1 degrees in 2100 would only be diminished to an increase of 1.9 degrees. Or to put it another way, the temperature increase that the planet would have experienced in 2094 would be postponed to 2100.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this does not prevent global warming, but merely buys the world six years. Yet the cost of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, for the United States alone, will be higher than the cost of solving the world&amp;rsquo;s single, most pressing health problem: providing universal access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Such measures would avoid 2 million deaths every year, and prevent half a billion people from becoming seriously ill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is crucial that we look at the facts if we want to make the best possible decisions for the future. It may be costly to be overly optimistic - but more costly still to be too pessimistic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R.OG1.1 The Dover Bronze-Age Boat</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r.og1.1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 13:11:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r.og1.1/</guid><description>

&lt;p>A beautifully preserved boat, made around 3,000 years ago and discovered by chance in a muddy hole, has had a profound impact on archaeological research.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It was 1992. In England, workmen were building a new road through the heart of Dover, to connect the ancient port and the Channel Tunnel, which, when it opened just two years later, was to be the first land link between Britain and Europe for over 10,000 years. A small team from the Canterbury Archaeological Trust (CAT) worked alongside the workmen, recording new discoveries brought to light by the machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the base of a deep shaft six metres below the modern streets a wooden structure was revealed. Cleaning away the waterlogged site overlying the timbers, archaeologists realised its true nature. They had found a prehistoric boat, preserved by the type of sediment in which it was buried. It was then named the Dover Bronze-Age Boat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About nine metres of the boat’s length was recovered; one end lay beyond the excavation and had to be left. What survived consisted essentially of four intricately carved oak planks: two on the bottom, joined along a central seam by a complicated system of wedges and timbers, and two at the side, curved and stitched to the others. The seams had been made watertight by pads of moss, fixed by wedges and yew stitches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The timbers that closed the recovered end of the boat had been removed in antiquity when it was abandoned, but much about its original shape could be deduced. There was also evidence for missing upper side planks. The boat was not a wreck, but had been deliberately discarded, dismantled and broken. Perhaps it had been &amp;lsquo;ritually killed, at the end of its life, like other Bronze-Age objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With hindsight, it was significant that the boat was found and studied by mainstream archaeologists who naturally focused on its cultural context. At the time, ancient boats were often considered only from a narrower technological perspective, but news about the Dover boat reached a broad audience. In 2002, on the tenth anniversary of the discovery, the Dover Bronze-Age Boat Trust hosted a conference, where this meeting of different traditions became apparent. Alongside technical papers about the boat, other speakers explored its social and economic contexts, and the religious perceptions of boats in Bronze-Age societies. Many speakers came from overseas, and debate about cultural connections was renewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within seven years of excavation, the Dover boat had been conserved and displayed, but it was apparent that there were issues that could not be resolved simply by studying the old wood. Experimental archaeology seemed to be the solution: a boat reconstruction, half-scale or full-sized, would permit assessment of the different hypotheses regarding its build and the missing end. The possibility of returning to Dover to search for the boat&amp;rsquo;s unexcavated northern end was explored, but practical and financial difficulties were insurmountable 一 and there was no guarantee that the timbers had survived the previous decade in the changed environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Detailed proposals to reconstruct the boat were drawn up in 2004. Archaeological evidence was beginning to suggest a Bronze-Age community straddling the Channel, brought together by the sea, rather than separated by it. In a region today divided by languages and borders, archaeologists had a duty to inform the general public about their common cultural heritage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The boat project began in England but it was conceived from the start as a European collaboration. Reconstruction was only part of a scheme that would include a major exhibition and an extensive educational and outreach programme. Discussions began early in 2005 with archaeological bodies, universities and heritage organisations either side of the Channel. There was much enthusiasm and support, and an official launch of the project was held at an international seminar in France in 2007. Financial support was confirmed in 2008 and the project then named BOAT 1550BC got under way in June 2011.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A small team began to make the boat at the start of 2012 on the Roman Lawn outside Dover museum. A full-scale reconstruction of a mid-section had been made in 1996, primarily to see how Bronze- Age replica tools performed. In 2012, however, the hull shape was at the centre of the work, so modem power tools were used to carve the oak planks, before turning to prehistoric tools for finishing. It was decided to make the replica half-scale for reasons of cost and time, and synthetic materials were used for the stitching, owing to doubts about the scaling and tight timetable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, the exhibition was being prepared ready for opening in July 2012 at the Castle Museum in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Entitled &amp;lsquo;Beyond the Horizon: Societies of the Channel &amp;amp; North Sea 3,500 years ago&amp;rsquo;, it brought together for the first time a remarkable collection of Bronze-Age objects, including many new discoveries for commercial archaeology and some of the great treasure of the past. The reconstructed boat, as a symbol of the maritime connections that bound together the communities either side of the Channel, was the centrepiece.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R.OG1.2 The changing role of airports</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r.og1.2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 13:11:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r.og1.2/</guid><description>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Airports continue to diversify their role in an effort to generate income. Are business meeting facilities the next step? Nigel Halpern, Anne Graham and Rob Davidson investigate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In recent times developing commercial revenues has become more challenging for airports due to a combination of factors, such as increased competition from Internet shopping, restrictions on certain sales, such as tobacco, and new security procedures that have had an impact on the dwell time of passengers. Moreover, the global economic downturn has caused a reduction in passenger numbers while those that are travelling generally have less money to spend. This has meant that the share of revenue from non-aeronautical revenues actually peaked at 54% at the turn of the century and has subsequently declined slightly. Meanwhile, the pressures to control the level of aeronautical revenues are as strong as ever due to the poor financial health of many airlines and the rapid rise of the low-cost carrier sector.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Some of the more obvious solutions to growing commercial revenues, such as extending the merchandising space or expanding the variety of shopping opportunities, have already been tried to their limit at many airports. A more radical solution is to find new sources of commercial revenue within the terminal, and this has been explored by many airports over the last decade or so. As a result, many terminals are now much more than just shopping malls and offer an array of entertainment, leisure, and beauty and wellness facilities. At this stage of facilities provision, the airport also has the possibility of taking on the role of the final destination rather than merely a facilitator of access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At the same time, airports have been developing and expanding the range of services that they provide specifically for the business traveller in the terminal. This includes offering business centres that supply support services, meeting or conference rooms and other space for special events. Within this context, Jarach (2001 ] discusses how dedicated meetings facilities located within the terminal and managed directly by the airport operator may be regarded as an expansion of the concept of airline lounges or as a way to reconvert abandoned or underused areas of terminal buildings. Previously it was primarily airport hotels and other facilities offered in the surrounding area of the airport that had the potential to take on this role and become active as a business space (McNeill, 2009).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When an airport location can be promoted as a business venue, this may increase the overall appeal of the airport and help it become more competitive in both attracting and retaining airlines and their passengers. In particular, the presence of meeting facilities could become one of the determining factors taken into consideration when business people are choosing airlines and where they change their planes. This enhanced attractiveness itself may help to improve the airport operator^ financial position and future prospects, but clearly this will be dependent on the competitive advantage that the airport is able to achieve in comparison with other venues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In 2011, an online airport survey was conducted and some of the areas investigated included the provision and use of meeting facilities at airports and the perceived role and importance of these facilities in generating income and raising passenger numbers. In total, there were responses from staff at 154 airports and 68% of these answered yes* to the question: Does your airport own and have meetings facilities available for hire? The existence of meeting facilities therefore seems high at airports. In addition, 28% of respondents that did not have meeting facilities stated that they were likely to invest in them during the next five years. The survey also asked to what extent respondents agreed or disagreed with a number of statements about the meeting facilities at their airport. 49% of respondents agreed that they have put more investment into them during recent years; 41% agreed that they would invest more in the immediate future. These are fairly high proportions considering the recent economic climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The survey also asked airports with meeting facilities to estimate what proportion of users are from the local area, i.e. within a 90-minute drive from the airport, or from abroad. Their findings show that meeting facilities provided by the majority of respondents tend to serve local versus non-local or foreign needs. 63% of respondents estimated that over 60% of users are from the local area. Only 3% estimated that over 80% of users are from abroad. It is therefore not surprising that the facilities are of limited importance when it comes to increasing use of flights at the airport: 16% of respondents estimated that none of the users of their meeting facilities use flights when travelling to or from them, while 56% estimated that 20% or fewer of the users of their facilities use flights.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="g">G&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The survey asked respondents with meeting facilities to estimate how much revenue their airport earned from its meeting facilities during the last financial year. Average revenue per airport was just $12,959. Meeting facilities are effectively a non-aeronautical source of airport revenue. Only 1% of respondents generated more than 20% non-aeronautical revenue from their meetings facilities; none generated more than 40%. Given the focus on local demand, it is not surprising that less than a third of respondents agreed that their meeting facilities support business and tourism development in their home region or country.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="h">H&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The findings of this study suggest that few airports provide meetings facilities as a serious commercial venture. It may be that, as owners of large property, space is available for meeting facilities at airports and could play an important role in serving the needs of the airport, its partners, and stakeholders such as government and the local community. Thus, while the local orientation means that competition with other airports is likely to be minimal, competition with local providers of meetings facilities is likely to be much greater.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R.OG1.3 IS PHOTOGRAPHY ART?</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r.og1.3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 13:11:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r.og1.3/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This may seem a pointless question today. Surrounded as we are by thousands of photographs, most of us take for granted that, in addition to supplying information and seducing customers, camera images also serve as decoration, afford spiritual enrichment, and provide significant insights into the passing scene. But in the decades following the discovery of photography, this question reflected the search for ways to fit the mechanical medium into the traditional schemes of artistic expression.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The much-publicized pronouncement by painter Paul Delaroche that the daguerreotype* signalled the end of painting is perplexing because this clever artist also forecast the usefulness of the medium for graphic artists in a letter written in 1839. Nevertheless, it is symptomatic of the swing between the outright rejection and qualified acceptance of the medium that was fairly typical of the artistic establishment. Discussion of the role of photography in art was especially spirited in France, where the internal policies of the time had created a large pool of artists, but it was also taken up by important voices in England. In both countries, public interest in this topic was a reflection of the belief that national stature and achievement in the arts were related.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the maze of conflicting statements and heated articles on the subject, three main positions about the potential of camera art emerged. The simplest, entertained by many painters and a section of the public, was that photographs should not be considered &amp;lsquo;art&amp;rsquo; because they were made with a mechanical device and by physical and chemical phenomena instead of by human hand and spirit； to some, camera images seemed to have more in common with fabric produced by machinery in a mill than with handmade creations fired by inspiration. The second widely held view, shared by painters, some photographers, and some critics, was that photographs would be useful to art but should not be considered equal in creativeness to drawing and painting. Lastly, by assuming that the process was comparable to other techniques such as etching and lithography, a fair number of individuals realized that camera images were or could be as significant as handmade works of art and that they might have a positive influence on the arts and on culture in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Artists reacted to photography in various ways. Many portrait painters 一 miniaturists in particular - who realized that photography represented the ‘handwriting on the wall’ became involved with daguerreotyping or 60 paper photography in an effort to save their careers； some incorporated it with painting, while others renounced painting altogether. Still other painters, the most prominent among them the French painter, Jean- Auguste-Dominique Ingres, began almost immediately to use photography to make a record of their own output and also to provide themselves with source material for poses and backgrounds, vigorously denying at the same time its influence on their vision or its claims as art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The view that photographs might be worthwhile to artists was enunciated in considerable detail by Lacan and Francis Wey. The latter, an art and literary critic, who eventually recognised that camera images could be inspired as well as informative, suggested that they would lead to greater naturalness in the graphic depiction of anatomy, clothing, likeness, expression, and landscape. By studying photographs, true artists, he claimed, would be relieved of menial tasks and become free to devote themselves to the more important spiritual aspects of their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wey left unstated what the incompetent artist might do as an alternative, but according to the influential French critic and poet Charles Baudelaire, writing in response to an exhibition of photography in 1859, lazy and untalented painters would become photographers. Fired by a belief in art as an imaginative embodiment of cultivated ideas and dreams, Baudelaire regarded photography as &amp;lsquo;a very humble servant of art and science,； a medium largely unable to transcend &amp;rsquo;external reality&amp;rsquo;. For this critic, photography was linked with &amp;rsquo;the great industrial madness&amp;rsquo; of the time, which in his eyes exercised disastrous consequences on the spiritual qualities of life and art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eugene Delacroix was the most prominent of the French artists who welcomed photography as help-mate but recognized its limitations. Regretting that &amp;lsquo;such a wonderful invention&amp;rsquo; had arrived so late in his lifetime, he still took lessons in daguerreotyping, and both commissioned and collected photographs. Delacroix&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm for the medium can be sensed in a journal entry noting that if photographs were used as they should be, an artist might &amp;lsquo;raise himself to heights that we do not yet know&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question of whether the photograph was document or art aroused interest in England also. The most important statement on this matter was an unsigned article that concluded that while photography had a role to play, it should not be &amp;lsquo;constrained&amp;rsquo; into &amp;lsquo;competition&amp;rsquo; with art； a more stringent viewpoint led critic Philip Gilbert Hamerton to dismiss camera images as &amp;rsquo;narrow in range, emphatic in assertion, telling one truth for ten falsehoods5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These writers reflected the opposition of a section of the cultural elite in England and France to the &amp;lsquo;cheapening of art&amp;rsquo; which the growing acceptance and purchase of camera pictures by the middle class represented. Technology made photographic images a common sight in the shop windows of Regent Street and Piccadilly in London and the commercial boulevards of Paris. In London, for example, there were at the time some commercial establishments where portraits, landscapes, and photographic reproductions of works of art could be bought. This appeal to the middle class convinced the elite that photographs would foster a desire for realism instead of idealism, even though some critics recognized that the work of individual photographers might display an uplifting style and substance that was consistent with the defining characteristics of art.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When it comes to celebrating the flavor of food, our mouth gets all the credit But in truth, it is the nose that knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>No matter how much we talk about tasting our favorite flavors, relishing them really depends on a combined input from our senses that we experience through mouth, tongue and nose. The taste, texture, and feel of food are what we tend to focus on, but most important are the slight puffs of air as we chew our food - what scientists call &amp;lsquo;retronasal smell&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Certainly, our mouths and tongues have taste buds, which are receptors for the five basic flavors: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami, or what is more commonly referred to as savory. But our tongues are inaccurate instruments as far as flavor is concerned. They evolved to recognise only a few basic tastes in order to quickly identify toxins, which in nature are often quite bitter or acidly sour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the complexity, nuance, and pleasure of flavor come from the sense of smell operating in the back of the nose. It is there that a kind of alchemy occurs when we breathe up and out the passing whiffs of our chewed food. Unlike a hound&amp;rsquo;s skull with its extra long nose, which evolved specifically to detect external smells, our noses have evolved to detect internal scents. Primates specialise in savoring the many millions of flavor combinations that they can create for their mouths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taste without retronasal smell is not much help in recognising flavor. Smell has been the most poorly understood of our senses, and only recently has neuroscience, led by Yale University&amp;rsquo;s Gordon Shepherd, begun to shed light on its workings. Shepherd has come up with the term &amp;rsquo;neurogastronomy&amp;rsquo; to link the disciplines of food science, neurology, psychology, and anthropology with the savory elements of eating, one of the most enjoyed of human experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In many ways, he is discovering that smell is rather like face recognition. The visual system detects patterns of light and dark and, building on experience, the brain creates a spatial map. It uses this to interpret the interrelationship of the patterns and draw conclusions that allow us to identify people and places. In the same way, we use patterns and ratios to detect both new and familiar flavors. As we eat, specialised receptors in the back of the nose detect the air molecules in our meals. From signals sent by the receptors, the brain understands smells as complex spatial patterns. Using these, as well as input from the other senses, it constructs the idea of specific flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This ability to appreciate specific aromas turns out to be central to the pleasure we get from food, much as our ability to recognise individuals is central to the pleasures of social life. The process is so embedded in our brains that our sense of smell is critical to our enjoyment of life at large. Recent studies show that people who lose the ability to smell become socially insecure, and their overall level of happiness plummets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working out the role of smell in flavor interests food scientists, psychologists, and cooks alike. The relatively new discipline of molecular gastronomy, especially, relies on understanding the mechanics of aroma to manipulate flavor for maximum impact. In this discipline, chefs use their knowledge of the chemical changes that take place during cooking to produce eating pleasures that go beyond the &amp;lsquo;ordinary&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, whereas molecular gastronomy is concerned primarily with the food or &amp;lsquo;smell, molecules, neurogastronomy is more focused on the receptor molecules and the brain&amp;rsquo;s spatial images for smell. Smell stimuli form what Shepherd terms *odor objects&amp;rsquo;, stored as memories, and these have a direct link with our emotions. The brain creates images of unfamiliar smells by relating them to other more familiar smells. Go back in history and this was part of our survival repertoire; like most animals, we drew on our sense of smell, when visual information was scarce, to single out prey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus the brain&amp;rsquo;s flavor-recognition system is a highly complex perceptual mechanism that puts all five senses to work in various combinations. Visual and sound cues contribute, such as crunching, as does touch, including the texture and feel of food on our lips and in our mouths. Then there are the taste receptors, and finally, the smell, activated when we inhale. The engagement of our emotions can be readily illustrated when we picture some of the wide- ranging facial expressions that are elicited by various foods - many of them hard-wired into our brains at birth. Consider the response to the sharpness of a lemon and compare that with the face that is welcoming the smooth wonder of chocolate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The flavor-sensing system, ever receptive to new combinations, helps to keep our brains active and flexible. It also has the power to shape our desires and ultimately our bodies. On the horizon we have the positive application of neurogastronomy: manipulating flavor to curb our appetites.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docs: R.OG2.2 Dawn of the robots</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r.og2.2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 13:11:52 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/r.og2.2/</guid><description>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>They’re already here 一 driving cars, vacuuming carpets and feeding hospital patients. They may not be walking, talking, human-like sentient beings, but they are clever&amp;hellip; and a little creepy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="a">A&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>At first sight it looked like a typical suburban road accident. A Land Rover approached a Chevy Tahoe estate car that had stopped at a kerb; the Land Rover pulled out and tried to pass the Tahoe just as it started off again. There was a crack of fenders and the sound of paintwork being scraped, the kind of minor mishap that occurs on roads thousands of times every day. Normally drivers get out, gesticulate, exchange insurance details and then drive off. But not on this occasion. No one got out of the cars for the simple reason that they had no humans inside them; the Tahoe and Land Rover were being controlled by computers competing in November&amp;rsquo;s DARPA (the U.S. Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) Urban Challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="b">B&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The idea that machines could perform to such standards is startling. Driving is a complex task that takes humans a long time to perfect. Yet here, each car had its on-board computer loaded with a digital map and route plans, and was instructed to negotiate busy roads; differentiate between pedestrians and stationary objects; determine whether other vehicles were parked or moving off; and handle various parking manoeuvres, which robots turn out to be unexpectedly adept at. Even more striking was the fact that the collision between the robot Land Rover, built by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Tahoe, fitted out by Cornell University Artificial Intelligence (Al) experts, was the only scrape in the entire competition. Yet only three years earlier, at DARPA&amp;rsquo;s previous driverless car race, every robot competitor 一 directed to navigate across a stretch of open desert 一 either crashed or seized up before getting near the finishing line.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="c">C&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It is a remarkable transition that has clear implications for the car of the future. More importantly, it demonstrates how robotics sciences and Artificial Intelligence have progressed in the past few years 一 a point stressed by Bill Gates, the Microsoft boss who is a convert to these causes. ‘The robotics industry is developing in much the same way the computer business did 30 years ago,&amp;rsquo; he argues. As he points out, electronics companies make toys that mimic pets and children with increasing sophistication. ‘I can envision a future in which robotic devices will become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day-to-day lives/ says Gates. ‘We may be on the verge of a new era, when the PC will get up off the desktop and allow us to see, hear, touch and manipulate objects in places where we are not physically present.'&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="d">D&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What is the potential for robots and computers in the near future? ‘The fact is we still have a way to go before real robots catch up with their science fiction counterparts,&amp;rsquo; Gates says. So what are the stumbling blocks? One key difficulty is getting robots to know their place. This has nothing to do with class or etiquette, but concerns the simple issue of positioning. Humans orient themselves with other objects in a room very easily. Robots find the task almost impossible. &amp;ldquo;Even something as simple as telling the difference between an open door and a window can be tricky for a robot,&amp;rsquo; says Gates. This has, until recently, reduced robots to fairly static and cumbersome roles.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="e">E&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For a long time, researchers tried to get round the problem by attempting to re-create the visual processing that goes on in the human cortex. However, that challenge has proved to be singularly exacting and complex. So scientists have turned to simpler alternatives: ‘We have become far more pragmatic in our work,’ says Nello Cristianini, Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bristol in England and associate editor of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. ‘We are no longer trying to re-create human functions. Instead, we are looking for simpler solutions with basic electronic sensors, for example. &amp;lsquo;This approach is exemplified by vacuuming robots such as the Electrolux Trilobite. The Trilobite scuttles around homes emitting ultrasound signals to create maps of rooms, which are remembered for future cleaning. Technology like this is now changing the face of robotics, says philosopher Ron Chrisley, director of the Centre for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Sussex in England.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="f">F&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Last year, a new Hong Kong restaurant, Robot Kitchen, opened with a couple of sensor-laden humanoid machines directing customers to their seats. Each possesses a touch-screen on which orders can be keyed in. The robot then returns with the correct dishes. In Japan, University of Tokyo researchers recently unveiled a kitchen zandroid7 that could wash dishes, pour tea and make a few limited meals. The ultimate aim is to provide robot home helpers for the sick and the elderly, a key concern in a country like Japan where 22 percent of the population is 65 or older. Over US$1 billion a year is spent on research into robots that will be able to care for the elderly. &amp;lsquo;Robots first learn basic competence 一 how to move around a house without bumping into things. Then we can think about teaching them how to interact with humans,’ Chrisley said. Machines such as these take researchers into the field of socialised robotics: how to make robots act in a way that does not scare or offend individuals. ‘We need to study how robots should approach people, how they should appear. That is going to be a key area for future research,&amp;rsquo; adds Chrisley.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
