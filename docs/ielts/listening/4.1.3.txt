4.1.3

execute me, doctor john sen, may I speak to you for a minute?

sure. come in.

I am x, I am taking your course in population studies.

Right, well, x, how can i help u.

i am having a bit of trouble with the second assignment. and it's due in twelve days.

what is the problem that you having?

Is the assignment question or problem?

well, that's part of the problem.

I am also having, been having trouble getting hold the books.

I been to the library several times, all the books are out.

sounds like you should start borrowing the books be earlier

I had a realy big assignment do in for a other course, and I've been speet on my time on that.

You might get a extension of time to finish your assignment for me?

If that's possible, but I don't know..

well, Yes, It's possible, but extensions are normally given only for medical or compa reasons

ortherwise, It's really a question of organzing your study. and we don't like giving extension to students who simply didn't plan their work properly.

what did you get for your first assignment?

I got eighty-seven persent.

you did very well, indeed, so oviously you can produce good work.

I don't think I will need too much extra time, as long as I can get hold of some of the important references.

well, since you do so well in your frist assignment, I am prepared to give you an extra two weeks for this one

so that would mean you need to submit it about a month from now.

now what about the reading materials, are you chekout the general articles in the list?

no not yet. there were about twenty of them, and i wasn't show which one would be most useful or important.

they all useful, but i don't expect anyone to read them all, because a number of them deal with the same issues.

and let me give you some suggestions.

the article by xx and yy is really worth reading.

right, i will read that one.

you should also read the article by JS. but just look the part of rearch methology how they did it.

and if you have time, the one by robos, sounds very relevant things, aloght it's not essential.

ok, if is useful, i will try to read that one.

now the one by xx, i won't bother with that at this stage if i were you.

ok, i wouldn't bother with xx. oh now some one tell me the article by xxx is important

oh, yes, in a way. but just look the last part where is discuss the research results.

and last there is xxx, i can't think why i include that one

it not bad, and could have some help, but not so much.

---

now let's deal with your assignment questions. what's the problem there.

it's the graph on page 2.

what seems to the problem, it's just the bar of graph showing reasons why people change where they live

I got a photo copy, but the reasons at the bottom were missing

oh, ok, look at the first bar on the graph. that indicates a number of people who move because they want more space.

bar two is to do with the people living nearby disturbing them so they chose to move away to somewhere quiet

now, that's look at bar number three, another reason that people change place their living becouse they want to be colser to the city.

ok xxx to the city is an issue.
