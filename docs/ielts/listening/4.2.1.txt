Oh, Peter, there you are. You’ve been ages. What kept you so long?

I am sorry I am so late, have you been waiting long?

half an hour, but it doesn't matter,

I had a coffee, and I've been reading this guide book for tourist. Sit down.

you look very hot and tired, what would you like to drink?

I would love a realy chilly mineral water or something, would you have another coffee.

Yes, I will, the waitress will be back in the moment. why were you so late, did something happen?

yes, you know i went to bank, to cash some trival check.

well, the exchange rate was looking healthy, but when I went to the teller, they told me the computer system was temporary down. so they couldn't do any transactions.

they said the problem will be fix in a few minutes. so i wait it,

and then I start to talk to another guy in the bank, and i forgot the time.

so many manu in the bank. does he work there?

no he is tourist, from NY, his name is HR, and he has been here for a week, and he is moving on to Garmeny tomorrow,

he is an architect, he is speeding four weeks traveling around Europe,

just like us.

yes just like us, he told me the names of some places where we should eat.

great food, not to expensive he said.

he also gave me this map of the bus system he said he didn't need anymore.

that's useful, pity he is moving on tomorrow.

oh, here is waitress, let's order.

do you want anything to eat, or we just have a drink.

i am hungry, and we got a lot of sightseeing to do, so let's just have a snack and drink.

sounds good to me!

---

well, let's decide what we see today. i guest the best place to get start is Cathedral, and then the castle.

what are the opening time for those two?

well according to this guide book, the Cathedral is only opening 9.30 in the morning until midday.

oh no hang on, that is the cathedral museum.

the cathedral itself is open morning and afternoon.

the castle is just open from 1 to 5, so we can't go there unitl after lunck.

i realy want to spend some time in the Art gallary. because it's got wonderful paiting by xxx, i always wants to see.

what else should we see?

well the guidebook says the xx Garden worth spending some time

and they are opening all day from 8 to 6, so we can go there anytime.

i like to go to the markets near the river too. but, oh, no way, that's only in the morning too.

as well as today and tomorrow, we can see some other places on monday you know

but i don't think the market will be open then. they only open on thursdays so we miss them this week

may be we should go to Cathedral today, becaust it's sunday tomorrow ,

And even though it’s open every day, it might be more difficult to get in tomorrow because of the church services.

that's true, but the Art gallary isn't open on sundays at all. so we will have to go there today.

the castle is open every day except mondays, so we are ok there. and the gardens is only close at night.

are all this places free or do we have to pay to go in. what do this guidebook say?

i think there is a charge for all of them except the xxx garden oh and the market. of cause you don't pay to go in.

well, looks like our plan is this: we will go to see the painting you like first the xxx

and then have a lunch and go on the castle after that and the cathedral

ok, it says here that the roof of cathedral looks very beautiful.

is that right? what i really want to do at the cathedral is climb the tower.

the view is supposed to be spectacular.

that will be more then enough today.

then tomorrow let's go to the xx garden, and have a picnic

I want to sit by the river and watch the wans? this citys is famous for them
