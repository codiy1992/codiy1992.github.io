good afternoon everybody, and welcome to riverside industrial village

to start your visit, I am just going to give you a brief `kan` of the history of the museum before letting you run about on your own, I won't keep you long ok ?

now from where we are standing, you go view of the river over there.

and it was because this is far flowing water, this side was natural place for manufacture works.

the water and the availability of raw materials in the areas like mineral and iron all and also the abundance of local fuels like coal and fire woods, all make this side suitable for industry from very early time.

Water was the main source of power for the early industries. and some of water will first established in the 12 century will you believe.

at that time, local craftsmen first built icon forge just behind the village here on the band in the river.

By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the region's rivers supported more than a handured and sixty water milks and many of this contiune to operate where into the nineteenth century.

but then, the still engagine was invented, and then the rallways came, and the centre of the industry was able to move away from the rivers of the countryside and into the towns, so industrial villages like this one became very rare.

so that's the history for you. if you like any more information, you can ask me some questions. or you can read further in our excellent guide book.
