Advertising</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/1/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Positives of Advertising&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Advertising is a key part of modern business&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies need to tell customers about their products&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertisements inform us about the choices we have&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertising is a creative industry that employs many people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without advertising we would have less choice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Without advertising there would be higher unemployment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertising is a form of modern art&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People enjoy adverts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negatives of Advertising&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Advertising manipulates people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It aims to persuade people that buying a product will make them happier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertisers focus on selling a brand image&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They use glamorous, successful people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We now live in a consumer culture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are persuaded to follow the latest trend&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are encouraged to associate certain brands with a higher status&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertisers often aim their marketing at children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children can easily be influenced by advertisements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children put pressure on parents to buy them things&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Opinions about Advertising&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Advertising should be regulated&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertising aimed at children should be controlled or even banned&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unhealthy foods should not be marketed in a way that attracts children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Products that can be risk to healthy should display warnings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In some countries it is illegal to advertise cigarettes on television&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warnings must be displayed on cigarette packets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, advertising is necessary in free market economies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It creates demand for products&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should only censor false information or products that are harmful&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>广告的好处&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>广告是现代商业重要组成&lt;/li>
&lt;li>公司需要告诉消费者他们的产品&lt;/li>
&lt;li>广告通知我们有的选择&lt;/li>
&lt;li>广告是一个创新型行业，它雇佣很多人&lt;/li>
&lt;li>没有广告我们的选择会更少&lt;/li>
&lt;li>没有广告将存在更高的失业&lt;/li>
&lt;li>广告是现代艺术的一种形式&lt;/li>
&lt;li>人们享受广告&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>广告的坏处&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>广告操纵人们&lt;/li>
&lt;li>它旨在说服人们买那些让他们开心的产品&lt;/li>
&lt;li>广告聚焦销售名牌形象&lt;/li>
&lt;li>他们使用有魅力的、成功的人们&lt;/li>
&lt;li>我们如今生活在一个消费者文化&lt;/li>
&lt;li>我们被说服去追随最新的潮流&lt;/li>
&lt;li>我们被鼓励去把特定的品牌和社会地位相联系&lt;/li>
&lt;li>广告者通常瞄准孩子为市场&lt;/li>
&lt;li>孩子能轻易地被广告所影响&lt;/li>
&lt;li>孩子给父母压力为了买给他们东西&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>对广告的观点&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>广告应该被规范&lt;/li>
&lt;li>针对孩子的广告应该被控制甚至禁止&lt;/li>
&lt;li>不健康的食品不应该以吸引孩子的方式市场化&lt;/li>
&lt;li>对健康有危害的产品应该展示警告&lt;/li>
&lt;li>在一些国家在电视上广告香烟是非法的&lt;/li>
&lt;li>警告必须出现在香烟盒上&lt;/li>
&lt;li>然而，在自由市场经济中广告是必须的&lt;/li>
&lt;li>它为产品创造了需求&lt;/li>
&lt;li>政府只应该审查错误的信息或者有害的产品&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Docs: 10. Global issues</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/10/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problems in developing countries&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Developing countries face a range if problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Standards of healthcare and education are low&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life expectancy is usually lower than in developed countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a lack of infrastructure, employment and good quality housing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people are forced to live in poverty&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Food, drinking water and basic medicines are in short supply&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to help developing countries&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The best form of help for developing countries is development aid&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Richer nations can help by investing in long-term projects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments and charities can help by building new houses and schools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Globalization may also help developing countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Multi-national companies can creating jobs in developing countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the other hand, many people emigrate to find work in richer countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They often sand money back home to their families&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This money helps to improve the standard of living in developing countries&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Immigration&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people move to another countries in search of a better life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many immigrants come from less developed countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Richer, industrialized countries may offer opportunities for employment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Free healthcare and schooling are available in some developed countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other people migrate to a foreign country to improve their academic qualifications&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Positives of immigration and Multi-cultural societies&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>From an economic perspective, immigration can be extremely positive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many immigrants have skills that are needed in the country they move to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Immigrants who find work contribute to the economy of their new country&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many immigrants send money home to help family members&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Immigration also creates cultural diversity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People of many different nationalities learn to live together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This can help people to become more open-minded and tolerant&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negatives of Immigration&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people believe that immigrants take jobs that should go to local people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some immigrant workers work longer hours for less money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies might pay lower salaries to immigrant workers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unemployment rates could rise if there are too many immigrants&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Opinions about Immigration&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Immigration can help the economy of a country&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It can create multi-cultural societies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, immigration needs to be controlled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In many countries, immigrants need visas or work permit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should stop companies from exploiting immigrant workers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Foreign and local workers should have the right to equal pay and conditions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Positives of Globalization&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Business of becoming increasingly international&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Multi-national companies do business across the world&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies like MacDonald’s can be seen on high streets in most cities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goods are produced in one country and sold in many others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A global economy means free trade between countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This can strengthen political relationships&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Globalization can also create opportunities for employment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It encourages investment in less developed countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It could reduce poverty in the developing world&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negatives of Globalization&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Globalization is not always beneficial to everyone&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies can move to countries where labour is cheap&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This creates redundancies, or job losses&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Employees cannot be confident that they have stable jobs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies sometimes exploit their employees in developing countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Global trade creates more waste and pollution&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The future of Globalization&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There should be global regulations for salaries and working conditions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should impose laws to protect the environment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Docs: 11. Government and Society</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/11/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What governments can do&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Governments provide public services like healthcare and education&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They support people who are living in poverty or unable to work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments raise money by taxing working people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can spend money on resources and campaigns&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can introduce new laws&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can impose taxes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can raise people’s awareness of issues (e.g climate change/healthy eating)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can influence people’s habits and opinions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can create jobs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can regulate the activities of companies such as banks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can provide resources for schools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are also responsible for the security and well-being of their citizens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They control armed forces and police forces&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Public services&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Governments pay the salaries of public sector workers like police officers and teachers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The necessary money is raised by taxing people’s income&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Free education and healthcare may be provided by the state&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some governments control public transport systems and even TV channels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In other countries, these services are provided by private companies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people believe that competition between private companies is good&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It helps to improve quality while bringing prices down&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other people think that essential services should be free&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should pay for them&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Censorship: Opinion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Governments can censor what public sees or reads in the media&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To a certain extent censorship is necessary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should use censorship to protect children from violent images&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some computer games involve killing people or committing crimes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Internet also needs to be controlled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many websites show pornography and violence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There should be age limits for websites and computers games&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents need to take responsibility for checking what their children watch&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is impossible for governments to control everything we see&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Video cameras in public places&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The use of CCTV is becoming widespread&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Video cameras have been installed in many public places&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are supposed to protect us and deter criminals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people think that this surveillance violates our privacy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The authorities could build databases with our pictures and identities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should not be treated like criminals&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Smart cards: Positives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Governments will probably introduce a digital identification card system&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smart cards will have benefits and drawbacks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They could help to reduce crime&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They could hold personal information, such as DNA&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Digital bank cards could contain fingerprint information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It would be very difficult for criminals to use a stolen card&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It would be easier for police to identify people and catch criminals&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Smart cards: Negatives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many people are worried about losing their privacy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments could store all our personal and medical information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This information could be used by insurance companies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Employers could check our health records&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>People with Disabilities&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People with disabilities should be treated the same as everybody else&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should have the same rights as other people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should have access to the same jobs as other citizens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discriminations against disabled people is illegal in many countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ramps and lifts for wheelchairs should be installed in public buildings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support teacher can be employed to help children with learning difficulties&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Docs: 12. Guns and Weapons</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/12/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why guns should be legal:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In some countries, people are allowed to own firearms&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Individuals have the right to protect themselves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People can use guns in self defence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This deters criminals&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why gun ownership should be illegal:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is a risk of accidents with guns&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The number of violent crimes increases when guns are available&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Criminals may be armed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The police then need to use guns&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suicide rates have been shown to rise when guns are available&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guns create violent societies with high murder rates&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why polices should use guns&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many criminals use weapons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The threat of a gun can deter criminals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Police officers can forces a criminal to surrender&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is easier to arrest someone and avoid physical violence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The police may shoot violent criminals in self defence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can protect the public&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can shoot an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why police should not carry guns&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is a risk of accidents and mistakes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The police might shoot an unarmed criminal or an innocent person&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accidents can happen in public places&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are several alternatives to guns (e.g tear gas, sprays and electric shock weapons)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only special police units should use guns&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arm Trade: Positives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The export of arms, or weapons, is an extremely controversial issue&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments of rich, industrialized countries sell arms to each other&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This industry creates jobs and wealth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The trade of weapons may improve relationships between governments&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arms Trade: Negatives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Weapons may be used in conflicts and wars&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The supply of arms could be responsible for deaths&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments are promoting war in order to make a profit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rich countries can influence the politics of other nations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nuclear weapons&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nuclear weapons are capable of destroying whole cities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A nuclear war between two countries would destroy both countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nuclear weapons are used as a deterrent&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They prevent wars from starting&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nuclear weapons: Opinion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nuclear weapons should be prohibited&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should limit the production of nuclear weapons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a danger of nuclear weapons being obtained by terrorists&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nuclear weapons cannot be used against terrorist organizations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Armed Forces: Positives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Armed forces provide security and protection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They deter military attack by another country&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can also be sued to maintain peace within countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can be sued to give the police extra support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Soldiers are also used to help in emergency situations, such as after a natural disaster&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Armed forces: negatives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Armies require a lot of funding from governments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Too much money is spent on weapons and military technology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This money could be spent on schools, hospitals and other public services&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Docs: 13. Health</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/13/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Diet&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The human body requires a balanced diet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An unhealthy diet can cause various health problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Obesity, diabetes and heart disease are on the increase&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people nowadays rely on fast food or pre-prepared meals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These foods often contain too much fat, salt and sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are cheap to buy and very easy to prepare&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many young people have grown up on a diet of convenience foods&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Populations in developed countries are increasingly overweight&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Exercise&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Regular exercise is essential in maintaining a healthy body&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exercise burns calories and helps to build healthy bones and muscles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Doctors advise exercising at least three times a week for 20 minutes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most people nowadays lead a sedentary lifestyle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We tend to walk less and do desk jobs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most adults relax by watching television&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children play video games rather than doing outdoor sports&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the past, people were more active in their jobs and at home&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Government’s Role&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Governments have a significant role to play in reducing obesity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More and more people, including young children are seriously overweight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are at risk of heart disease and diabetes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This situation will increase the burden on hospitals and taxpayers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hospitals rely on the government for money and resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should promote a healthy diet and regular exercise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There should be more time for sports on school timetables&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unhealthy junk food should be banned from school menus&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People need information about what foods contain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Food packaging must show the food’s nutritional content&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The British Government recommends eating five portions of fruit and vegetables per day&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>State Health system: advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Good healthcare should be available to everyone for free&lt;/li>
&lt;li>State healthcare is paid by the government using money from taxes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone has access to the same quality of care and treatment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Private healthcare is unfair because only wealthy people can afford it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The National Health Service in the UK provides free healthcare for every resident&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Private Healthcare: advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>State hospitals are often very large and difficult to run&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Private hospitals have shorter waiting lists for operations and appointments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Patients can benefit from faster treatment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people prefer to pay for more a personal service&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Patients have their own room and more comfortable facilities&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Alternative medicine: Positives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People are increasingly using alternative medicines to treat illnesses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For example, acupuncture can be used to treat backache&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Herbal medicines can be used to treat allergies or viruses&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many patients report positive experiences with these treatments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some traditional cures have been used for hundreds of years&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Alternative medicine: Negatives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many alternative medicines have not been tested scientifically&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They may have no beneficial effect at all&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They may cause unknown side effects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should trust the opinions of qualified doctors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An illness could get worse without treatment from a doctor&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stress&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Modern lifestyles are increasingly stressful&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People work long hours with strict deadlines&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our busy lifestyles mean we have less time to relax&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unemployment is a major cause of stress&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children may be affected by their parents’ relationship problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tests and exams can also cause stress&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to reduce stress&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Stress can be reduced by taking regular exercise and eating a healthy diet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is also important to get sufficient sleep and make leisure time a priority&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should work less overtime and take regular holidays&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schools have started to employ psychologists&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can offer emotional support to students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can help students to cope with exam stress&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Docs: 14. Housing and Architecture</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/14/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/14/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>State/council housing&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In some countries the government provides state or council housing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This helps people who cannot afford to buy their own house&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It can be argued that state housing creates dependence on the government&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should be rely on the government to look after them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People have no incentive to earn money and buy their own home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Council properties are often made with cheap, poor-quality materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Old Buildings&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Historic buildings are part of a country’s heritage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should be protected&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Old buildings are often considered to be works or art&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They give character to cities and attract tourists&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They show us how people lived in the past&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We identify countries by architectural symbols like the pyramids in Egypt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should spend money on looking after historic buildings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They need regular repairs and maintenance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New buildings should be designed to complement them&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Modern/green buildings&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Modern buildings should be designed to be environmentally friendly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should use less energy and produce less waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modern insulation can make houses more energy-efficient&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solar and wind power can be used to generate electricity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rainwater and waste water can be recycled and used to flush toilets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modern glass buildings take advantage if natural light&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>English as an international language&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>English is widely used around the world&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is becoming a global second language&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is the dominant language of technology, science and international business&lt;/li>
&lt;li>International business meetings are regularly held in English&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The most important textbooks and journals are published in English&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ability to speak English is a necessary skill in the modern world&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negative of English as an International Language&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If one language is dominant, other languages may disappear&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The dominant language brings its own culture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>American culture has become popular around the world&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other cultures may be damaged&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As an alternative to English, a new global language could be invented&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It would have no nationality or culture attached to it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This could help to promote international peace and understanding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Esperanto is an example of a language that was invented with this aim&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Money and Society&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Society has become increasingly materialistic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People aspire to earn more money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They want a bigger house or a better car&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We connect wealth and material possessions with happiness and success&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brands like “Armani” or ”Mercedes” are status symbols&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertising creates new desires and needs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It persuades us to buy the latest styles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Positives of Consumerism&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consumerism creates employment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It helps to reduce poverty&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It encourages innovation and creativity in business&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We live in a global economy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have a better quality of life&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negatives of Consumerism&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consumerist societies create more waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They use more natural resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They cause damage to the environment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consumerism creates a “throw-away” culture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertisers tell us who we are and what we want&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wealth does not lead to happiness&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Materialism causes greed and crime&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should return to traditional values like sharing&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Happiness&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Happiness means different things to different people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It can be described as a feeling of pleasure or enjoyment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People enjoy spending time with family and friends&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hobbies, sports and games can be a source of fun and enjoyment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people see money as a source of happiness&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other people define happiness as something deeper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In order to be truly happy it is necessary to live a good life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We need to feel that we are doing something useful with our lives&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people get a sense of achievement from their work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Others find happiness in bringing up their children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Religion or a sense of purpose can also be a source of happiness&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Success&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People define success in different ways&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people get a sense of achievement from raising a family&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For others, success is defined by wealth or status&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We often think of rich and famous people as being successful in life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Millionaires like Bill Gates are considered to be successful&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They have risen to the top in their chosen professions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For some, being successful means achieving personal or professional goals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They see success as the result of hard work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Success in any field requires long-term planning and effort&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nature or Nurture&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people believe that our personalities are determined mainly by genetics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We inherit our abilities and talents from our parents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Others think that our education and upbringing are more important&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We develop according to the influences around us&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our personalities and achievements depend more on nurture than nature&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people argue that we control our own destinies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can shape our own personalities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By working hard we can achieve and goal that we put our minds to&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many successful people are “self-made”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are not limited by our genetic characteristic or upbringing&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arguments against Professional/competitive sport&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sport has become a business&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Professional sport encourages people to compete for money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some athletes take drugs in order to win at any cost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Competitors are often selfish and rude&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are not good role models for children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All sports should be amateur&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sports should be leisure activities rather than jobs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should do sporting activities for enjoyment and health reasons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taking part is more important than winning&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arguments for Professional sport&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Professional sports are the same as any other business&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people are employed in the sports industry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should be able to use their talents to earn a salary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sports stars entertain millions of people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Money is necessary to improve facilities and train athletes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The level of professional sport is much higher than that of amateur sport&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arguments for Competitive sport&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Competition is a natural instinct in humans&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In daily life we compete to get jobs or the highest grades&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sports are a safe form of competition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Competition is healthy because it pushes us to give our best&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Competitors and fans can release energy and aggression&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Supporters of teams feel a sense of belonging to a community&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Opinion: professional sport salaries are too high&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sports professionals earn too much money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They do not provide a vital service&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Football players, for example, earn enormous salaries by simply kicking a ball&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We could all live happily without professional football&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life would be difficult without doctors, engineers and other vital professionals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Society does not seem to value these professions as highly as professional sport&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sports salaries should be compatible with the wages most people earn&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Opinion: professional sport salaries are fair&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It is fair that the best professional earn a lot of money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sport is a multi-million-pound industry**&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a large audience of sports fans&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sports on television attract many viewers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sports stars have dedicated hours of practice to developing their fitness and skills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Only the most talented among them will reach the top&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A sports career many only last 10 years&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sports fans are willing to pay to support their teams&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sports and Politics&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people think that sport and politics should remain separate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments are involved in the hosting of sporting events such as the Olympics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These events attract investment and create jobs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Olympic Games are an advertisement for the host nation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They attract huge numbers of visitors and sports fans&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wealthy countries tend to hold these events&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developing countries should be given the chance to become hosts&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arguments for Animal testing&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Animals are used in important scientific research&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is necessary to do medical tests on new drugs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Animal testing helps to advance medical and scientific knowledge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many important medical discoveries involved experimentation on animals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Researchers aim to minimize the suffering that animals experience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Testing for the cosmetics industry is now banned in many countrie&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arguments against Animal Testing&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The benefits of research using animals do not justify the suffering caused&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are alternative methods of research&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The lives of animals should be respected&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Humans have no moral right to do experiments on animals&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arguments for Vegetarianism&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vegetarians do not eat foods that are produced by killing animals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people choose a vegetarian diet for moral or health reasons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A healthy diet is possible without eating meat&lt;/li>

&lt;li>A vegetarian diet may reduce the risk of disease like cancer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people question the treatment of animals in factory farms&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Arguments against Vegetarianism&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Vegetarians do not eat a balanced diet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In many cultures, meat is the main ingredient in traditional meals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meat-eaters argue that animals are below humans in the food chain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is completely natural for us to kill them for food&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our aim should be improve farming methods&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Farms should produce organic food&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Positives of Zoos&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Zoos paly an important role in wildlife conservation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can help to protect endangered species&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zoos allow scientists to study animals and their behavior&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zoos are educational, interesting and fun&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children, in particular, enjoy learning about animals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zoos provide job opportunities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negatives of Zoos&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Zoo animals are kept in artificial environments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are kept in cages or have limited space&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zoo animals rely on humans&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They lose the freedom to hunt for food&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They best way to save endangered species is by protecting natural habitats.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people believe that zoos are unethical&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zoos exhibits animals with the aim of making money&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>动物被用于重要的科学研究&lt;/li>

&lt;li>动物试验帮助促进医学和科学研究&lt;/li>
&lt;li>很多重要的医学试验涉及到在动物上的试验&lt;/li>
&lt;li>科研工作者旨在最小化动物经历的遭难&lt;/li>
&lt;li>化妆行业的测试目前在很多国家已经被禁止&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>反对动物试验的论据&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>使用动物对研究的好处并不能证明其造成的遭难是合理的&lt;/li>
&lt;li>有可替换的科研方法&lt;/li>
&lt;li>动物的生命应该被尊敬&lt;/li>
&lt;li>人类没有道德权去在动物身上做试验&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>素质主义者不吃杀死动物得到的食物&lt;/li>
&lt;li>许多人选择素食主义的日常饮食是出于道德和健康的原因&lt;/li>
&lt;li>不吃肉也可能有一个健康的日常饮食&lt;/li>

&lt;li>一个素食主义的日常饮食或许会减少像癌症这样疾病的风险&lt;/li>
&lt;li>许多人质疑工厂化工厂的动物得到的对待&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>反对素食主义的论据&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>素食主义者没有吃一个平衡的日常饮食&lt;/li>
&lt;li>在许多文化里，肉是传统餐的主要原料&lt;/li>
&lt;li>肉食者争论说在食物链中动物是在人类之下的&lt;/li>
&lt;li>杀死它们获取食物对我们而言十分自然&lt;/li>
&lt;li>我们的目标应该是提高耕作方法&lt;/li>
&lt;li>农田应该生产有机食品&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>动物园的好处&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>动物园在野生生物保护方面发挥一个重要的作用&lt;/li>
&lt;li>它们可以帮助保护濒危物种&lt;/li>
&lt;li>动物园允许科学家研究动物及其它们的行为&lt;/li>
&lt;li>动物园可以是有教育意义的、有趣的和好玩的&lt;/li>
&lt;li>特别是孩子，喜欢学习有关动物&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>动物园的坏处&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>动物园的动物被关在人工环境里&lt;/li>
&lt;li>它们被关在笼子里或者只有有限的空间&lt;/li>
&lt;li>动物园的动物依赖人类&lt;/li>
&lt;li>它们丧失的捕获食物的自由&lt;/li>
&lt;li>最好的保护濒危物种的方法是保护自然栖息地&lt;/li>
&lt;li>一些人认为动物园是不道德的&lt;/li>
&lt;li>动物园为了赚钱而展览动物&lt;/li>
&lt;li>我们没有权利为了娱乐和利益而使用动物&lt;/li>

&lt;li>The price of goods, services and housing may increase significantly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The future of tourism&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Tourism should have a low impact on wildlife&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Renewable resources like solar or water power should be used&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Losing traditional skills&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Because of industrialization and global trade, many traditions have disappeared&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Global advertising encourages everyone to buy the same products&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most products are now made in factories&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Machinery has replaced skilled human labour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Factory work is boring and leaves people feeling unfulfilled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goods are produced very quickly and in large numbers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Products are cheaper, which means that more people can buy them&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Examples&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Clothes are mass produced in standard sizes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People wear similar clothes, rather than traditional costumes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jeans and T-shirt are now worn throughout the world&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Historic buildings took skilled craftsmen years to build&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modern concrete, steel and glass buildings are built in only weeks or months&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are fewer people who can create hand-made goods&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Traditional customs&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Traditional customs are still important during weddings and religious festivals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People wear traditional costumers and eat special foods&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is important to maintain our different cultural identities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should celebrate festivals, teach traditional skills and protect historic places&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Docs: 22. Transport</title><link>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://note.codiy.net/ielts/writing/topics/22/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Traffic problems&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Traffic congestion is caused by commuters travelling to work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most people live in the suburbs outside city centre&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Commuters tend to travel at the same time of day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They tend to travel alone&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cars and road space are not used efficiently&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This causes traffic jams during the rush hour&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Traffic solutions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In order to reduce traffic we should change our working habits&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The internet can now be used to connect people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More people could work from home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meetings can be held as video conferences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Workers could be given flexible timetables&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another solution would be to tax drivers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Workers should share their cars and travel together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In London, for example, there is a congestion charge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This helps to raise money for better public transport&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public transport needs to be reliable and efficient&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Positives of Public transport&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We need to reduce our dependence on cars&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parking a car can be extremely difficult in big cities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Well-designed transport systems are comfortable and convenient&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modern public transport can be fast and cheap&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public transport can help to reduce pollution in cities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Investment in buses and trains will ease traffic congestion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buses can be given special lands to avoid traffic&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negatives of public transport&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Public transport if often slow and unreliable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Metro systems and trains are often dirty and crowded&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People feel like “sardines in a can”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cars are much more comfortable&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Road safety&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Driving while tired or drunk is extremely dangerous&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mobile phones can be a dangerous distraction for drivers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They draw the driver’s attention away from the road&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The use of phones while driving has been banned in many countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Punishments are becoming stricter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Television campaigns are used to remind people to drive safely&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speed cameras have become more common&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speed bumps are another form of traffic calming&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many streets are designed with the aim of slowing traffic down&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Importance of clean water&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Water is as necessary natural resource&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Humans need access to clean, safe drinking water in order to live&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Poor water quality is a major cause of disease and death in some countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water usually needs to be treated before we can drink it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developing countries often lack the means to treat and supply water to citizens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Developed countries tend to have much better sanitation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Citizens have access to clean tap water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drinking water is not contaminated by sewage or waste water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The supply of clean water would improve public health in many developing countries&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Water supply&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Urban life would be impossible without water supply systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These systems are massive engineering projects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many professionals are involved in their planning, construction and maintenance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The supply and distribution of water are major concerns&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water is becoming scarce in some countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Areas that suffer droughts often need to import water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As populations grow, there is more pressure on water supplies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This could lead to a water crisis&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Water and politics&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The supply of water is also an important political issue&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Huge amount of water are needed for agriculture and industry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The irrigation of crops accounts for a large proportions of water use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A water crisis could lead to political conflicts or even wars&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Argument: water should be free&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people believe that water should be free for everyone&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should supply water to all homes at no cost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Private companies should not be allowed to profit from this natural resource&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Money from taxes can be used to pay for water supply systems&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Argument: water should not be free&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If water is free, people take it for granted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They do not think about how much water they waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They leave taps running while washing or brushing their teeth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we have to pay for water, we will use it more responsibly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water supply systems are extremely expensive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Investment is needed to maintain and improve them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Private companies may provide a better service than governments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If they provide an efficient service, they will make more money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They will repair leaks to avoid losing money&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bottled Water: Opinions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people carry bottles of water wherever they go&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For example, they take bottles of water to work or to the gym&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They believe that bottled water is healthier than tap water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They also argue that it tastes better&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, other people believe that we should consume less bottled water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plastic water bottles add to litter and waste problems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies should not be able to make a profit from water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is unethical to make money by selling packaged water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no difference in quality between bottled and tap water&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>The benefits of staying in the same job for life&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Employees have a stable career with one employer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They have a good pension and health insurance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Their salaries gradually increase&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They may be promoted within the organization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They demonstrate loyalty&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experienced staff can be trusted with more responsibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They become part of a team&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a clearly defined path for development&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The benefits of not staying in the same job&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People often change jobs in order to further their career&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another company may offer a promotion or a higher salary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People who change jobs can gain experience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can learn different skills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changing jobs is interesting and challenging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People can retrain in a different occupation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a fast-changing world workers need to be flexible&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People need to develop a range of experience and skills&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Self-employment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nowadays, it is easy to set up a company&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Internet provides a global marketplace&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-employment offers greater freedom than working for a company&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, there are risks to starting a new business&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-employed people may face financial difficulties&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many businesses fail to make a profit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is less stability in self-employment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are no benefits like pensions, sick pay and holiday pay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-employment involved hard work, long hours and total responsibility&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Unemployment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unemployment is a big problem for individuals, communities and society&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people are unable to find a job&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They may not have the sufficient level of education or qualifications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They may find themselves homeless&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unemployment causes frustration and stress&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jobless people may become involved in crime as a means to get money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The unemployed need careers advice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments need to provide vocational courses and retraining&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Unemployment benefits: positives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some governments pay unemployment benefits in order to help jobless people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unemployed people need financial support until they find a new job&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By claiming benefits they can continue to pay for their homes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The benefits system helps to reduce poverty, homelessness and crime&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Unemployment benefits: negatives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people claim benefits rather than working&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They become dependent on the government&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are not motivated to find a job&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The benefits system is a burden on taxpayers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All citizens should work to earn a living and support themselves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Receiving benefits affects people’s self esteem&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Work/Life Balance&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It is important to achieve a balance between work time and leisure or family time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Too much work can result in stress and poor health&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“workaholics” may neglect their families and friends&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People need to take regular holidays&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies should be expect employees to work overtime&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nowadays, many people work part-time or have flexible working hours&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technology allow people to work from home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many companies provide childcare facilities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A good work/ life balance can raise job satisfaction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Happy, healthy workers are more productive&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Technology and work&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Internet, fax and mobile phone technologies have revolutionized working life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Workers can communicate via email, online networks and video conferencing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technology can connect workers in different countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It gives people more freedom&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It can also save time and money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people believe that offices could disappear in the future&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Virtual online offices may replace them&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Child labour&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In some countries, children are exploited&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They do repetitive jobs for very low pay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children are often used in agriculture and factory work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The employment of children is prohibited in other countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many people think that children should be free to enjoy their childhood&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should make education a priority&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should build new schools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should supply the resources to educate children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children need to be given the knowledge and skills for adult life&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Reasons for Urbanization&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People move to cities in search of job opportunities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cities offer greater employment possibilities and a higher standard of living&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People migrate to cities from the countryside&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Traditional activities like farming need fewer workers nowadays&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Negatives of City Life&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Life in cities has its drawbacks&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The cost of living is higher than in rural areas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some people d not manage to find work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Housing is usually much more expensive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Homelessness and poverty are common on cities There is a gap between rich and poor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Life in cities can be extremely stressful&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are problems like traffic congestion and crime Cities lack a sense of community&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People do not even know their neighbor&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cities are sometimes described as “concrete jungles”.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pedestrian Areas&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pedestrian zones in city centre can improve the local environment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Banning cars encourages people to walk or cycle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many European cities have built bicycle lanes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dependence on cars is linked to health problems like obesity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People who walk or cycle regularly are generally healthier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pedestrian areas are safer and more attractive for both residents and tourists&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>城市化的原因&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>人们迁移到城市为了寻求工作机会&lt;/li>
&lt;li>城市提供更多的就业机会和更高的生活水平&lt;/li>
&lt;li>人们从农村迁移到城市&lt;/li>
&lt;li>像耕作一样的传统活动如今需要更少的工作人员(大机器农业)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>城市生活的消极之处&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>城市的生活有其缺陷&lt;/li>
&lt;li>生活成本高于农村地区&lt;/li>
&lt;li>一些人没有设法找到工作&lt;/li>
&lt;li>住房通常更贵&lt;/li>
&lt;li>无家可归和贫穷在城市常见&lt;/li>
&lt;li>富人和穷人之间存在间隔&lt;/li>
&lt;li>存在问题，如交通堵塞和犯罪&lt;/li>
&lt;li>城市缺乏社区感&lt;/li>
&lt;li>人们甚至不知道他们的邻居&lt;/li>
&lt;li>城市有时候被形容为钢筋水泥丛林&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>步行区域&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>城市中心的步行区域可以提高局部环境&lt;/li>
&lt;li>禁止汽车鼓励人们步行或骑行&lt;/li>
&lt;li>许多欧洲城市建立了自行车道&lt;/li>
&lt;li>对汽车的依赖和肥胖类的健康问题相关&lt;/li>
&lt;li>经常步行或骑行的人通常更健康&lt;/li>
&lt;li>对居民和旅行者而言，步行区域更安全和更具吸引力&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Police and Crime Prevention&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The job of the polices is to catch criminals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They must also prevent crime and make communities safer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There should be an increase in the number of police officers on the streets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Police officers should be seen as part of the community&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should be involved with education and prevention&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The police should be in close contact with schools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should focus on young people who have dropped out of school.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These teenagers may become involved with gangs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Punishments/Prisons&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fines are used as punishment for minor crimes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the crime is more serious, prison is the most common punishment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some criminals pose a threat to society&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are put in prison to ensure the safety of other citizens&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negatives of Prisons&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Criminals are put together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They make friends with other offenders&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many prisoners re-offend when they are released&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A criminal record makes finding a job more difficult&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rehabilitation&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Another aim of prisons is rehabilitation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prisoners receive education of vocational training&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prisoners should learn personal skills and specific job skills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Punishment could make prisoners’ behavior worse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rehabilitation aims to make them better citizens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rehabilitated prisoners are less likely to re-offend&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Capital punishment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Supporters say that capital punishment deters crime&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fear of the death penalty stops people from committing offences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The death penalty shows that crime is not tolerated&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is a form of revenge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The cost of imprisonment is avoided&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The offender cannot pose a threat to others&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Against Capital Punishment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Innocent people could be wrongly convicted and executed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Crime rates are not necessarily reduced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many criminals do not think they will be caught&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Capital punishment is not a good deterrent&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Executing prisoners creates a violent culture and encourages revenge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have no right to take another human life&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Community service&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Community service is a way to reform offenders&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It could be a solution to prison overcrowding&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It avoids the cost of imprisonment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It makes offenders useful in their local communities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are required to clean streets or talk to school groups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Offenders repay their community&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They avoid the negative influence that prison can have&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Against community service&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Community service is not a sufficient punishment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Criminals should be locked up, away from their victims&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Crime in the Media&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Crime is one of the main subjects of most news programs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The mass media focus on violent and sensational crimes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This lead to fear of crime among the public&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sensational stories attract more viewers or readers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The media report crime stories in order to increase their audience&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Benefits of education&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Education gives people knowledge and skills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People with qualification are more likely to find work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can earn a higher salary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They can contribute positively to society&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schools aim to teach young people moral values such as tolerance and sharing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schools prepare children to be members of a society&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Benefits of Studying Abroad&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Foreign institutions may offer better courses&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many students want to attend a prestigious university&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The best universities employ teachers who are experts in their fields&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Qualifications gained abroad can open the door to better job opportunities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Living abroad can broaden students’ horizons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Overseas students are exposed to different cultures and customs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They become more independent&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are responsible for cooking, cleaning and paying bills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They will learn a foreign language&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Drawback of studying abroad&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Living and studying abroad can be difficult&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students have problems with paperwork such as visa applications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The language barrier can be a problem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students have to find accommodation and pay bills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Studying in a foreign language is challenging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Living alone in an unfamiliar culture can cause homesickness&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Technology in Education: Advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Technology is a powerful tool to engage students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technology can make lessons much more interesting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students can do research using online resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students can study at their own place&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adults can take distance learning courses&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students can study whenever and wherever they want&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students also learn skills which are useful for their future jobs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For example, they learn to write reports using a word processor&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Technology in Education: Disadvantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People rely too much on computers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Young learners do not become proficient in some basic skills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They use word processors and spelling may suffer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People should be able to write a letter by hand&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technology is no substitute for a real teacher&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learners need a structured course&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An experienced teacher knows what materials to choose&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Computers are expensive to maintain and can be unreliable&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Technology in Education: Opinion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Institutions should supplement traditional teaching with the use of technology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Technology is part of everyday life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It can enhance a teacher’s lessons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students can use online resources to help with homework&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students must still learn to write by hand&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should still use traditional sources of information such as books&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Education in Developing countries: Problems&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Children often have to work from an early age There are no schools in many areas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Families do not have access to books or computers Literacy rates are often low&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People in developing countries need knowledge and skills Education is the key to improving the economy of these countries&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Education in developing countries: solutions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Developed countries could help developing nations by providing money&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They could invest in schools and technology&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They could supply the funds to build schools and pay for teachers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children need to have access to free schooling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Computer equipment could be donated&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Internet can expose students to a world of knowledge and information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should make education compulsory for all children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should encourage parents to send their children to school&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments of developed and developing countries must work together&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Higher education: Advantages (also see “benefits of education”)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are many benefits to going to university&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A degree can open the door to better employment prospects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Economies are becoming increasingly knowledge-based&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most jobs require specific knowledge and skills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Skilled workers are needed for sectors such as information technology and engineering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repetitive manual jobs are now done by machine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many factories have moved to developing countries&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Higher education: Disadvantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A healthy economy needs a wide range of workers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some manual workers will always be needed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A university degree is not necessary for many service professions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Practical training is more important in some industries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the UK, for example, there is currently a shortage of plumbers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Their services are therefore becoming more and more expensive&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantage of Home-schooling&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some parents decide to educate their children at home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some families live in isolated areas with poor transport&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other parents are not satisfied with local schools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents can respond to what their children need and how they learn best&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One-to-one lessons allow much faster progress&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The child can work at his or her own pace&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discipline problems are avoided by home-schooling&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disadvantages of home-schooling&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Most parents do not have the time to educate their children at home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One parent would need to give up work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>School subjects are normally taught by up to ten different teachers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most parents do not have the necessary knowledge or resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Private tutors are expensive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children will miss out on the social experience that school offers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At school, children learn how to get on with each other&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Home-schooled children may lack social skills&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schools offer a better overall educational experience&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bad behavior in schools: causes&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bad behavior is due to a lack of structure and discipline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are too many children in some classes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Large classes are difficult to manage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>May disruptive students come from an unstable family background&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Other parents are too lenient and spoil their children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some children are used to getting whatever they want&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schools can do very little if they are not supported by parents&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bad behavior in schools: solutions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Schools need a clear code of conduct&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schools need a clear set of rules about behavior&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They need to create a positive working atmosphere&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teachers must have the power to punish disruptive students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schools should remove difficult children from lessons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schools need to work closely with parents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discipline could be lacking at home&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents must support the school rules&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should take responsibility for their children’s behavior&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Corporal Punishment: Opinion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Corporal Punishment is not a good idea&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Physical punishment is a way of controlling children using fear&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This does not promote trust between adults and children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children who are punished physically may become shy or resentful&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Corporal punishment creates an atmosphere of fear and anger&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Single Sex Education: Advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people believe that male and female students should go to separate schools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is often for religious or cultural reasons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discipline problems might be avoided by separating boys and girls&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Boys and girls may learn in different ways and have different needs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Student at single-sex schools often get better exam grades.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Single-sex Education: Disadvantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Separating boys and girls is unnecessary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is unhealthy in terms of children’s social development&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many coeducational schools are extremely successful&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A mixed-sex environment is more representative of real life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coeducational schools provide children with better social skills for adult life&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advantages of Streaming (grouping children according to ability)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some schools separate students according to their academic ability&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teachers can work at the right speed for their students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teachers can plan more suitable lessons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>High-level groups may progress faster&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lower level groups can benefits from a slower pace&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some teachers and parents support streaming for these reasons&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disadvantages of Streaming&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Grouping by ability may have a negative impact on students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children do not want to be seen as less intelligent than others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Streaming could damage students’ self esteem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They may lose motivation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Students from wealthier families tend to be better prepared&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children from poorer families may receive less support from parents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mixed ability classes encourage everyone to achieve their potential.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Global warming&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gases such as carbon dioxide trap heat from the sun&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This causes global temperatures to rise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This process is known as the greenhouse effect&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Human activity is a major factor in the rise of the greenhouse gases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Factories and vehicles produce emissions and exhaust fumes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many developing countries are becoming industrialized&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The number of cars on our streets is growing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cheap air travel is allowing more people to fly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Effects of Global Warming&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Global warming will have a significant impact on our planet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rising temperature will cause melting of the polar ice caps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sea levels will rise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can expect more extreme weather conditions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Flooding and droughts may become more common&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Impacts of humans on the environment&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The increasing world population is putting pressure on natural resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fossil fuels like oil and gas are running out&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are destroying wildlife habitats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have cut down enormous areas of rainforest&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This has led to the extinction of many species of animals and plants&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solutions to environment problems&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Governments could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should invest in renewable energy from solar, wind or water power&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They could impose “green taxes” on drivers and airlines companies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Government campaigns should promote recycling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Natural areas and wild animals should be protected&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Individuals should also try to be greener&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should take fewer flights abroad for holidays&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should take public transport rather than driving&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should choose products with less packaging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should recycle as much as possible&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Waste/rubbish&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The amount of waster we produce has increased&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This problem is a result of our consumer culture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Products are not made to last&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If something breaks, we throw it way and buy a new one&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advertisers encourage is to buy the newest fashions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Packaging is an important part of selling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most foods are sold in non-biodegradable plastics packaging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The amount of household waste is growing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This waste ends up in landfill sites&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Litter&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People do not think about the consequences of dropping rubbish&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They assume that somebody is pad to clean the streest&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plastic packaging does not break down easily&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the litter seen on streets is fast food packaging&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Recycling and other solutions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Companies should make goods that last longer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should not use so much packaging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should be stricter, about waster produced by companies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should put legal limits on packaging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consumers should avoid buying over-packaged products&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should recycle and reuse useful materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There are collection banks for glass, paper and plastic bottles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Households can use several rubbish bins to separate waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recycling saves energy and raw materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nuclear Power: Positives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are several benefits to build more nuclear power stations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fossil fuel like oil and gas are running out&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nuclear power is a sustainable energy source&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It can be used to produce electricity without wasting natural resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It could be replace the use of natural resources like coal, oil or gas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nuclear power stations are cleaner than fossil fuel power stations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They could help to reduce carbon emissions that cause global warming&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The risks of accidents are being reduced&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nuclear Power: negatives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Opponents of nuclear power worry about the safety of power stations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The building of new nuclear power stations is unpopular&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nobody wants to live near one&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nuclear waste disposal is a significant problem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is currently no way to decontaminate radioactive material&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People worry that terrorists could steal radioactive materials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is safer to produce energy from solar, wind or water power.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Family size&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Families in many countries are not as large as they used to be&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We tend to live in small nuclear families rather than large extended families&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents tend to have fewer children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Young children are no longer expected to work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nowadays both parents often work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It costs so much to bring children up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is more difficult to raise a large family&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Working parents (also see “gender” topic)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Children and their parents seem to be less close nowadays&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents spend less time with their children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Women traditionally stayed at home to cook, clean and look after children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nowadays both parents often work full time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children may be left alone, or with nannies or babysitters&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Busy parents have less contact with their children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many families no longer eat meals together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children spend more time with friends or surfing the Internet&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negative effects on Children&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The lack of closeness in families can have a negative effect on children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many parents have no idea how their children spend their time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friends, television and the Internet become the main influence on children’s behavior&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teenagers are influenced by peer pressure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some of them join gangs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Juvenile delinquency is on the increase&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents should be more involved with their children’s upbringing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Young people need positive role models&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Divorce&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In the past, divorce was unacceptable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It was considered to be embarrassing for a family&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People stayed together for religious or family reasons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divorce is more socially acceptable nowadays&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It has become much more common&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divorce can be extremely stressful&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lone parents may face financial difficulties&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many single parents have to rely on benefits paid by the state&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Divorce can have a negative effect on children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Children from single-parent families are more likely to get lower grades or drop out of school.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The rise in divorce rates may be connected to some social problems&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Care for Old people&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Caring for elderly people was traditionally the responsibility of families&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adults had to look after their elderly parents&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A woman’s job was to stay at home taking care of her family&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nowadays, fewer elderly people are looked after by their relatives&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Residential homes provide care for large number of elderly people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some families are unable to look after elderly relatives&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Families tend to be smaller these days, and women often have full-time jobs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cares homes provide a professional service for senior citizens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nurses are better trained than family members&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Care for Old people: Opinion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The best form of care for the elderly depends on the family situation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It depends on whether family members have the time resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We all have a responsibility towards the older people in our society&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governments should invest money in facilities and training for care workers.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Gender and education&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Men and women should have access to the same educational opportunities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Males and females should be accepted onto courses according to their abilities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is wrong to discriminate against students because of their gender&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gender should be irrelevant in education&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Student’s achievements should depend on hard work and individual merit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the UK, there are similar numbers of male and female students in higher education&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Gender and work&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Men and women should have access to the same professional opportunities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both man and women should be able to pursue a career&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should earn equal salaries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They should be employed according to their abilities, qualifications and experience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Traditionally women have been restricted to certain roles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They were often employed as secretaries or receptionists&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nowadays, a range of occupations is available to both sexes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Career success depends on individual merit&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Women’s and Men’s roles in the Family&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some people argue that a mother should not work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>She should stay at home and bring up her children&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The father should be the breadwinner of the family&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Others believe that both parents should share these responsibilities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Working women can take maternity leave during and after pregnancy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many mothers continue to work after this period&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many fathers and mothers share their parenting and domestic responsibilities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They contribute equally to childcare, cooking and cleaning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some women many have better career prospects than their husbands.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paternity leave and “househusbands” are becoming more common&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Traditional gender roles and gradually changing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Families can divide roles and responsibilities in the most convenient way.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Positives of genetic engineering&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Genetic engineering is the practice of manipulating the genes of an organism&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is used to produce crops that are more resistant to insects and diseases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some genetically modified crops grow more quickly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some drugs and vaccines are produced by genetic engineering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It may become possible to change human’s genetic characteristics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scientists may use genetic engineering to cure diseases.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inherited illnesses would no longer exist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Genes could be changed before a baby is born&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It could also be possible to clone human organs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We could all have replacement body part&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Humans could live longer, healthier lives&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Negatives of genetic engineering&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are ethical concerns about human genetic engineering&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parents might want to choose their children’s characteristics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This would be unnatural&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It would be unacceptable in most religions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Soldiers could be cloned from the genes of the strongest people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clones might be used like robots to do certain jobs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clones might even be developed just for organ replacements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Society and human evolution would change completely&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Currently, human genetic engineering is prohibited&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Genetically-Modified (GM) foods: Advantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Farmers can produce crops that grow bigger and faster&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some GM crops are more resistant to disease or insects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This could be important for food production in developing countries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster growing cereals, fruit and vegetables will mean more profit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GM foods can be modified to look perfect&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They may be more attractive to customers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Genetically-Modified (GM) Foods: Disadvantages&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There may be risks involved in the genetic engineering of foods.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GM crops might change whole ecosystems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Food chains could be broken if crops are resistant to predators&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Organic foods are produced without chemicals or genetic modification&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Organic farming may be slower and more expensive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, the environment is not damaged by fertilizers or pesticides.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
